<p class="center">BY RICHARD GRANT WHITE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Our inquiry in the first paper of this series led us to follow
the emigration of the Aryan, or Indo-European, peoples from
their original seat in Central Asia until we found them in possession
of the whole of Europe;—the whole, from Siberia to
the western shore of Ireland, from the Arctic Sea to the Mediterranean.
The people who were there before them, they seem
to have totally displaced, with the exception of a small remnant
in the Pyrenees, now and long known as the Basques.
That there were people in Europe before the Aryans has been
clearly established by inquiries which here need only be thus
referred to. Neither the inquiries nor the people are anything
to our present purpose. As the Aryans began their westward
march more than four thousand years ago, this fact of preëxisting
European peoples is strong confirmatory evidence of
the truth of a quaint line in a little song in “Twelfth Night” (not
written by Shakspere, however),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">A great while ago the world began.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>That the Aryans killed all their predecessors in Europe is
hardly credible, even if possible; but that they were very
thorough in the performance of this function, is also more than
probable. The improving of other people off the face of the
earth is by no means an original American invention. It is a
process which long antedates the introduction of the arts of
civilization; and looking at the subject from the cold heights
of history and social science, it seems to have been a necessity,
preliminary to the introduction of those arts. The civilization
which now fills the best part of the earth, although not the
largest, and which seems destined to fill the whole, is in its
origin and development altogether Aryan. Probably much
the greater part of the primitive European peoples—primitive,
if they indeed had not also predecessors—were destroyed.
Certainly by the two processes of destruction and absorption
they were extinguished. The Aryans, however, were not mere
bands of armed men, armies large or small; they were emigrating
nations. The men were accompanied by their women
and children; and the probability therefore is that there was
little mingling of the blood of the superior and conquering
race with the blood of the inferior race, or races, whom they
conquered and displaced. At least, of such an intermingling
no appreciable traces have been discovered. There is in the
language of any of the Aryan peoples now in possession of
Europe no remnant, either verbal or constructive, of a language
like that of the Basques. The consequences in this respect
of the Aryan immigration into Europe were probably much
like the consequences of the entrance of that people into this
country. The American races have disappeared here before the
European, and have not in the slightest degree affected, in the
United States, at least, the blood, or the civilization or the
speech of the latter. “Indians,” as we strangely call them
(the real Indians being in Asia, and the “Indians” of America
having been so called because America on its discovery was
supposed to be the eastern part of Asia)—“Indians” should be
treated with justice and with all the humanity that can be
shown them; but it is a narrow and really an inhuman sentimentality
which mourns their displacement from the great
country which they once occupied as a savage hunting-ground.</p>

<p>We have now to inquire what English is; what is the substance
and the structure of the language which within only two
hundred and fifty years has choked and stilled even the echoes
of the speech of Sitting Bull, Squatting Bear, and their forefathers
and kindred. But before we go directly into this inquiry
it may be instructive, and I hope interesting, to glance
briefly at a few of the evidences which the discovery of Sanskrit,
and the consequent development of the science of comparative
philology, have revealed of the original identity of all
the Aryan peoples (those in Europe and those in Asia—that is
in Persia and India) and to make a rudimentary acquaintance
with the modes and processes by which this identity was
discovered.</p>

<p>No single word is so good an example of the testimony of
language to the common origin of the Indo-European peoples
as one of the commonest that we use, one which expresses
the first, or at least the second, thought that enters the human
mind—<i>me</i>. An infant, a worm, if it can think, has awakened
in it on its first touch of another object the consciousness of
something else and of itself:—that is not me, this is me. Now
the expression in sound of this first perception of the human
mind is the most widely diffused, and one of the most ancient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of existing words. In English, Frisian, Dutch, Icelandic,
Swedish, Danish, Mæso-Gothic, German, Irish, Gælic, Welsh,
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit,
the word expressing the objective recognition of self-hood is
either absolutely the same, or like with so little difference that
the slightness of the variation is remarkable. When we get to
the Latin and the Greek <i>me</i> (the accusative case—so-called—of
<i>ego</i>, I, which is common to both languages) we have gone
back more than two thousand years; and when we reach the
Sanskrit <i>mahyam</i>, with its dative <i>me</i> and its accusative <i>má</i>, we
are four thousand years in the past, and as many thousand
miles in Central Asia.</p>

<p>This one word, it should seem, was sufficient to indicate
identity of origin in all the European languages, ancient and
modern; and if not to produce conviction, to arouse attention
and stimulate investigation. When the word was found in
Sanskrit, it is not too much to say that identity of origin in all
the Indo-European tongues was so clear that further investigation
could discover only an accumulation of evidence. For
otherwise it would be necessary to assume some inherent, intrinsic,
or, as we say, some natural, relations between the idea
of objective self-hood and the sound <i>me</i>, or that very ancient
original sound of which it is a slight modification. But there
is no such relation. There is no such relation between any
word and any thought. If there were, then all the peoples of
the world would have expressed that idea, and would now express
it, by this sound, or by some modification of it. This,
however, is not true. It is and it has been so used only by the
peoples of the great Aryan or Indo-European family. But
what a tremendous fact it is, the use of this little word by hundreds
and thousands of millions of people over half the civilized
world for more than four thousand years, to express this
first thought that enters the mind of man!—people who were
strangers, and enemies, who were slaughtering each other as
they fought through the dark cycles of centuries for land,
for life, for supremacy; who hated each other as foreign
and alien; and who were all calling themselves, each to himself
and each to the other, <i>me</i>, and in doing so were telling each
other that they were of one blood and one speech!</p>

<p>It should be very distinctly remembered that the <i>me</i> (with its
variations) of the various European peoples is not <i>derived</i>
from the Sanskrit <i>mahyam</i>, <i>má</i>, or <i>me</i>, but that the Sanskrit
form, like the others, is derived from a root in the yet more
ancient, and now wholly lost, original Aryan speech. That
word, according to evidence which I believe is satisfactory to
all the great comparative philologists, is the pronominal root
<i>ma</i>, which, for reasons undiscovered, and which are probably
undiscoverable, was used to express the first person. Many
verbal roots have been thus satisfactorily unearthed; but in
the consideration of our subject it must never be forgotten, that
the Sanskrit, although it has proved to be the key that unlocks
the mysteries of language, and makes them no longer mysteries,
but mere successions of related facts, is not the original
fact or form of Aryan or Indo-European speech. No word in
Latin, Greek, in the Celtic, Teutonic, Slavic, or other European
tongues is derived from a Sanskrit word, although the two may
seem identical. Both are derived alike from an elder word
or root. The supreme importance of Sanskrit in the study of
language is in the fact that it is the oldest, very much the oldest,
of all the existing Aryan languages, and that it has been preserved
for thousands of years with a minute accuracy and a
religious devotion.</p>

<p>Having made this discovery about the word for that very
important, that most important, individual, <i>I</i>, we should naturally
expect that the words expressive of the first and most
important relation of that individual—that to his progenitors—would
be in like manner general, and in like manner preserved
among the various families of the Aryan race. This proved
to be the case. The word for mother, is, with very slight variation,
the same in all of them. For example, English <i>mother</i>,
Anglo-Saxon <i>moder</i>, Dutch <i>moeder</i>, Icelandic <i>mothir</i>, Danish
<i>moder</i>, German <i>mutter</i>, Celtic <i>mathair</i>, Russian <i>mat-e</i>, Latin
<i>mater</i>, Greek <i>m</i>e<i>t</i>e<i>r</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Sanskrit <i>matri</i>; and on the other side,
the male, we have, English <i>father</i>, Anglo-Saxon <i>fæder</i>, Dutch
<i>vader</i>, Danish <i>fader</i>, Icelandic <i>fathir</i>, Mæso-Gothic <i>fadar</i>,
German <i>vater</i>, Latin <i>pater</i>, Greek <i>pater</i>, Persian <i>pedar</i>, and
Sanskrit <i>pitri</i>. Here again we have followed these household
words through Europe and four thousand years into Central
Asia. The root of <i>mother</i>, or <i>mater</i>, is assumed to be <i>ma</i>;
although its significance is, I believe, yet unknown. That of
<i>father</i>, or <i>pater</i>, is assumed by most of the best scholars
(although on grounds which, with a hesitation only becoming
in me, I venture to think not absolutely satisfactory) to be <i>pa</i>,
conveying the idea of protection. In both cases, however,
there can be no doubt of the radical positions of the syllables
<i>ma</i> and <i>pa</i>; and thus we see a fact at once whimsically and
touchingly significant; that the two childish household words
<i>ma</i> and <i>pa</i>, so commonly, although not universally, used, are
at least representatives of a speech of such hoary antiquity
that it lies beyond the bounds of history and within the realm
of conjecture. <i>Ma</i> and <i>pa</i> antedate not only <i>mother</i> and
<i>father</i>, but the Sanskrit <i>matri</i> and <i>pitri</i>.</p>

<p>A difference between the historical forms of these two words
will be remarked by the observant reader. In <i>mother</i>, <i>mater</i>,
we have the initial consonant of the root preserved in all
tongues, from the beginning (or as near the beginning as we
can go); but in <i>fa-ther</i>, when we touch the Latin and the
Greek, the <i>f</i> becomes <i>p</i>, <i>pater</i>; and this we find was the sound
with which the word began in the elder speech,—Sanskrit <i>pitri</i>.
This fact, so far from being at all inconsistent with the substantial
identity of the word in its various forms, confirms that
identity. The difference is the result of a phonetic change by
which (according to well-established principles which can here
be only thus mentioned) certain consonant sounds change to
certain other sounds. The reason of this change is not known;
but it is known as an observed fact, which observed fact is
loosely called a law. We are in the habit of supposing that
what always takes place does so because of a rule of law. But
phonetic changes of this kind, which affect vowels and what
are called semi-vowels, as well as consonants, take place in
so regular a way that words can be traced through them with
a certainty which is almost if not quite unerring. This change
accounts not only for the <i>f</i> in <i>father</i>, but for the vowel difference
between the Latin <i>pater</i> and the Sanskrit <i>pitri</i>. And in
this word we have a good example in point as to the position
of Sanskrit in relation to the other related Aryan languages.
It is by no means certain, but rather the contrary, that the <i>i</i> in
the <i>pi</i> of the Sanskrit <i>pitri</i> is older than the <i>a</i> in the Latin
<i>pater</i> and the English <i>father</i>. The <i>a</i> in those words came
not by any phonetic change from the <i>i</i> in the Sanskrit <i>pitri</i>
and the Persian <i>pidar</i>. Probably, rather, it came directly
down to the Teutonic, the Gothic, and the Celtic languages from
that elder lost speech from which the Sanskrit as well as those
others is derived.</p>

<p>One other family and household word is illustrative of our
subject, and has a singular interest. Both <i>son</i> and <i>daughter</i>,
like <i>father</i> and <i>mother</i>, are found in most of the Indo-European
languages, and in Sanskrit. <i>Son</i> in Sanskrit is <i>súnu</i>, and is
reasonably assumed to be derived from <i>su</i>, to beget, to bear, to
bring forth. <i>Daughter</i>, the word just particularly referred to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
is in Anglo-Saxon <i>dohtor</i>, Dutch <i>dochter</i>, Danish <i>datter</i>, Swedish
<i>dotter</i>, Icelandic <i>dôttir</i>, Mæso-Gothic <i>dauhtar</i>, Russian
<i>do-che</i>, German <i>tochter</i>, Greek <i>thugat</i>e<i>r</i>, Sanskrit <i>duhitri</i>. And
if the generally accepted derivation of this word (which so
conforms to all the required conditions that there is no reasonable
ground of doubt about it) is correct, it records an interesting
fact and tells a little story. <i>Duhitri</i>, the Sanskrit for
<i>daughter</i>, is from <i>duh</i> or <i>dhugh</i>, which means, to milk; and
<i>daughter</i> means the milker, a milk-maid. The milk-maid of
the rural past has been gradually yielding place, first to an
Irish lad in cowhide boots, and next to a machine more or less
india-rubber in its structure; but within the memory of living
men, not aged, New England, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania
were filled with farmers’ daughters who performed a function
which fell naturally to their share in the distribution of work,
as it had done to their fore-mothers thousands of years before
on the plateau of Central Asia; and every time that father or
mother called one of them <i>daughter</i>, they heard unconsciously
the name of their household place and office. Nor have these
gentle milkers, these <i>dugh-i-tri</i>, I am glad to believe, quite
disappeared before the march of Celtic emigration and
machinery.</p>

<p>One of man’s first efforts at the orderly arrangement of
things is numbering them, counting; and numeral words
must have been among the earliest that were formed, and
among those which, being most constantly used, would be
most tenaciously preserved. So it proved. Most of the
numeral words, <i>one</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>three</i>, etc., in all the Indo-European
languages are found to be identical in origin, and some of them
essentially so in form. For clearness and brevity of illustration
let us take English <i>two</i>, which in Dutch is <i>twe</i>, Icelandic
(in the objective) <i>tvo</i>, Danish <i>to</i>, Swedish <i>tva</i>, Mæso-Gothic
<i>twai</i>, German <i>zwei</i>, Gælic <i>da</i>, Welsh <i>dau</i>, Russian <i>dva</i>, Latin
<i>duo</i>, French <i>deux</i>, Italian <i>due</i>, Greek <i>duo</i>, Sanskrit <i>dra</i>:—so
English <i>three</i> is in Dutch <i>trie</i>, Danish and Swedish <i>tre</i>, Icelandic
<i>thrir</i>, in the Celtic tongues <i>tri</i>, in Russian <i>tri</i>, Mæso-Gothic
<i>threis</i>, German <i>drei</i>, Latin <i>tres</i>, Greek <i>treis</i>, Sanskrit
<i>tri</i>. It is unnecessary to continue the illustration of this point.
Other numeral words are equally remarkable in their continuity;
and all are traceable to a remote antiquity and through a
wide dispersion.</p>

<p>One more pronoun may well be examined. The first thought
of the human mind, as we have already seen, on the perception
of something else than its own body is “me” and “not me:”
a dual thought, both elements of which come into consciousness
together:—this that I feel or see is not me. The second
perception is of what we call the second person, for which the
word in English until recently was, and among some English-speaking
people still is, <i>thou</i>. This word, which supplies one
of the commonest needs of life in language among people of
all conditions, has been preserved among all the Aryan peoples
for four thousand years almost without the signs of phonetic
wear and tear. In Old Frisian (the language which, next
to the so-called Anglo-Saxon, is nearest of kin to English) it is
<i>thu</i>, in Dutch (which of spoken languages is next nearest) it
has strangely disappeared, but in Icelandic it is <i>thu</i>, Danish
and Swedish <i>du</i>, in Mæso-Gothic <i>thu</i>, in German <i>du</i>, in the
Celtic tongues <i>tu</i>, in Russian <i>tui</i>, Latin, Italian and French
<i>tu</i>, Greek <i>su</i> (for <i>tu</i>), Persian <i>tu</i>, Sanskrit <i>tuam</i>.</p>

<p>As the intelligent reader considers these lists of common
words which are identical, or almost identical, in so many languages
spoken through forty centuries, from a period extending
far beyond historical records, the thought must arise that it
was strange, almost unaccountable, that the close connection,
the affiliation, of these languages was left to be clearly proved
within only about fifty years. But it must be remembered that
this affiliation in regard to some of them was as well known
before that time as it is now. That the Scandinavian tongues
were closely related, that English was connected with the
Scandinavian and the Teutonic languages, that French,
Spanish and Italian were close cousins, and were all direct
descendants (with some mixture by inter-marriage) from Latin,
was well known to all students of language. But beyond this
line they were all abroad. Of the connection of the Celtic
tongues—Welsh, Gælic, Erse (Irish) and Cornish—with the
Teutonic and the Scandinavian, or even with the Latin and
Greek (with which they are more nearly allied) there was no
knowledge. Nor was it supposed that Greek and Latin had
any other connection with English than that which existed
through Greek words and Latin words transplanted into English.
Latin was supposed to be derived from Greek, and indeed
to be a debased form of that language; and as to the
Sclavonic tongues, Russian, Polish, etc., they were the gabble of
outside barbarians.</p>

<p>Besides all this, the influence of theology upon narrow and
uninformed minds was felt in philology—if we can call the
linguistic studies of those days philological. As the proclamation
of the One God was made to the world in Hebrew, and as
the grand generalities of the Mosaic record of creation were
recorded in that language, it was assumed by many worthy
and really learned men, at whose fond fancy we may smile
but should not sneer, that Hebrew was the original speech of
the human race; that it was bestowed upon man directly by
divine beneficence; and that all the languages of the earth
were derived from that in which the ten commandments were
first written. Infinite labor, years of toilsome study, almost
endless efforts of perverted ingenuity were given to the mistaken
effort to establish this point, which was regarded by these
in-the-dark-working linguists as one, almost if not quite, of
religious importance. Now we know that the Hebrew language
is totally, radically different from all the Indo-European
languages; that they have no kinship whatever, and are as
unlike as if they were spoken on two separate planets by
creatures of different species. And besides, we know that
Hebrew is not even in the position of a parent speech, but is
one of a small, although very important family, the Semitic,
and that in this family its position is that of a cadet.</p>

<p>The consequence in linguistic study of the discovery of Sanskrit,
which was chief in importance, was not so much the establishment
of kindred among all the languages of Europe,
although that was very important, as the proof that they were
not (with notable exceptions) derived the one from the other,
but that they all were sprung from a common stock, to which
the principal of them must be traced, not through one another,
but directly. Thus the Danes and the Germans lie close together,
and there is some likeness in substance between their
languages, and a little in form; but it will not do to attempt to
trace the Danish and the other Scandinavian languages to the
German, or through the German to an older tongue. It is
found that of the Scandinavian languages and the German,
neither is derived from the other, but that both are the offspring
of a lost elder speech, Teutonic or Gothic, of which the Mæso-Gothic
is the oldest representative of which there are any remains.
It is also found that the Latin language is not derived
from the Greek, did not come through it, but that both Latin
and Greek come independently from either a common branch
of the old Aryan tongue, or directly from that tongue itself.
Moreover it is now pretty well established to the total subversion
of previous theories, that the Latin represents, or at least
retains, older forms of the parent language than are to be
found in Greek. This, however, is not true as to syntax, grammar,
in which Latin diverges much more than Greek does from
that approximation to the original language which we find in
Sanskrit.</p>

<p>Let us glance at this subject of grammar; in doing which,
without going into dry detail, or even into the niceties of construction,
we may by the examination of one or two salient
facts trace very clearly the connection of some of the most important
and divergent branches of Indo-European speech.
Every educated boy who has passed through a classical grammar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
school will remember his surprise, not to say his disgust,
at finding, after mastering toilfully a little Latin, that when he
entered upon the study of Greek, he found the Greek verb very
unlike the Latin in its conjugation, and much more complicated.
It has a middle voice which is reflective in its signification. For
example, <i>etupsa</i> means I struck, <i>etuphth</i>e<i>n</i>, I was struck, but
<i>etupsam</i>e<i>n</i>, I struck myself. It has in tenses not only present,
perfect, future, and so forth, but a first perfect and a second
perfect, a first plu-perfect and a second plu-perfect, a first future
and a second future, and, moreover, two pestilential contrivances
called the first and second aorists. Besides this, every
tense has not only a singular and a plural number, but a
dual number, by which the action or the being, or the suffering,
is confined to two persons—a sort of grammatical buggy.
The nouns, the pronouns, the adjectives, the very articles, have
also this dual number. This is a fact, an oppressive, mysterious,
unrelated fact with which the young student is brought
face to face, and into conflict with which he enters, wondering
at the cause of this bountiful dispensation of grammar.
When Sanskrit was discovered, it was found that this middle
voice, these first and second perfects, and futures, and first and
second aorists, these dual numbers of verbs, nouns, and what
not, were Sanskrit as well as Greek, and were nearly two thousand
years older than any Greek writing that exists. But
they are found not only in Sanskrit and in Greek. In the
Mæso-Gothic, which, as we have seen is our earliest representative
of one of the two great European divisions of Aryan
speech, to the other of which the Greek belongs—it, the Greek,
having separated itself at a time long before the historical period—in
this Mæso-Gothic we have also the middle voice, the
dual number, and tenses and inflections multitudinous. These
grammatical facts bind, and without other evidence would
bind, the Greek, the Teutonic or Gothic, and the Sanskrit languages
in a bond of kinship.</p>

<p>It had been supposed by classical scholars, and the supposition
yet lingers among them, that these Greek double perfects and
futures, these aorists, and these middle voices and dual numbers,
were the fruit of a great genius for language and literary
expression, that they had been elaborated and painfully produced
in the successive development of the Greek intellect—which
indeed was one of the most remarkable phenomena in
the history of the world. But the discovery of Sanskrit has
shown us that these grammatical excrescencies were mere relics
of a past; things that the Greek poets and philosophers found
made to their hands, and which they must use whether they
would or no. Nor are we relieved from the necessity of this
inference and its consequences by the fact that Sanskrit is a
highly elaborated language, and has been the object of religious
care and veneration on the part of profound grammarians
for many centuries. Its grammar has been thus solicitously
preserved and minutely studied <i>because</i> it was involved with
the Brahminical religion. Its origin dates back in the darkness
of savagery. The Mæso-Goths, who had no Greek intellect
or refinement, had in their language also the dual number,
the middle voice, and the swarming inflections. Nor only so.
In a corner of Scythian Europe, in Cimmerian darkness, were,
and are, a rude people, the Lithuanians, who lie between the
Prussians and the Russians, who had no literature, whose language
was not even written until it was furnished with characters
by strangers so late as the sixteenth century, who had not
advanced intellectually beyond the making of folk-songs and
ballads, whose very national existence was hardly more important
than that of Comanches or Piutes; and yet these people
had the dual number, the variety of inflection, and the
complicated grammar of the old speech. It had merely come
down to them as it had come to the Mæso-Goths, and to the
Greeks, and to the Brahmins, from the early days of the Aryan
people and their language. Simply this, and nothing more.</p>

<p>The fact upon this subject is that as we look backward
through history we find that grammar increases as civilization
and culture diminish; or, to put it conversely, that as culture
increases and civilization becomes more elaborate and complex,
grammar diminishes and simplifies, and gradually passes
away. The traits once regarded as special and distinguishing
excellencies of the Greek language, its dual number, its middle
voice, its double tenses, and to the horror of some of the
classical scholars among my readers, if I am honored by any
such—I add, even the aorists, are not signs of a high development
of language, but mere relics of barbarism. They are so
in the Greek, just as they are so in the Mæso-Gothic and in
the Lithuanian languages. They had no relation whatever to
the power, the subtlety and the loftiness of the Greek intellect;
they were not a necessary means nor even a happily adapted
tool for the work of that intellect in literature, in art, and in philosophy;
although it is not to be denied that the Greek intellect
did leave its impress upon the Greek language. The
Greeks were the great people that they were simply because
they were Greeks; we know not why; just as the Lithuanians
were and remained Lithuanians, we know not why. In the
one case the complicated instrument of expression had no
more to do with the splendid achievements of which it was
the medium than in the other it had to do with the rudeness
which it did not help to refine, or the obscurity to which it
lent no luster.</p>

<p>It is proper that I should say to my readers that in proclaiming
this I am teaching heresy. This is not orthodoxy, but my
doxy. I am willing to confess, like one who went long before
me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose, that
I speak as a fool; but I shall be content with the final verdict
that shall be passed upon me, whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Emphasizing for the moment the fact that this grammar
which increases with barbarism and which diminishes with civilization,
coexists only with inflection and depends upon it, and that
its diminution in the Latin development of Aryan speech as
compared with the Greek, was a purely rational, although
perhaps an unconsciously rational, movement, let us defer the
further consideration of this subject until another occasion.</p>

<p>One minute but very largely significant fact connected with
the Latin and Greek languages, which will be appreciated to a
certain degree at least by every schoolboy who has studied
those languages, may here properly be set forth and considered.
In Latin, the name of the supreme god, whose name in
Greek is Zeus, is Jupiter. Now <i>Jupiter</i> is no form of <i>Zeus</i>. It
can not “come from” Zeus by any mode of phonetic modification
or decay. Moreover, the declension of <i>Jupiter</i> through
the various substantive cases is notably irregular. It is:</p>

<table summary="Declension of “Jupiter”">
  <tr>
    <td><i>Nom.</i></td>
    <td>Jupiter,</td>
    <td>Jupiter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Gen.</i></td>
    <td>Jovis,</td>
    <td>of Jupiter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Dat.</i></td>
    <td>Jovi,</td>
    <td>to or for Jupiter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Accus.</i></td>
    <td>Jovem,</td>
    <td>Jupiter (objectively).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Voc.</i></td>
    <td>Jupiter,</td>
    <td>O, Jupiter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><i>Abl.</i></td>
    <td>Jove,</td>
    <td>with, in, from, or by Jupiter.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Now, <i>Jovis</i>, <i>Jovi</i>, <i>Jovem</i> and <i>Jove</i> can not be formed from Jupiter.
<i>Jovis</i> is no more a real case of <i>Jupiter</i> than <i>ours</i> is a real
case of <i>we</i>. How came the simple name of this god, used absolutely
or in the way of invocation, to be <i>Jupiter</i>, and yet
when used possessively to be <i>Jovis</i>, datively <i>Jovi</i>, etc.? To the
young student of Latin this is a barren, brutal fact with which he
is confronted, and which he is obliged to accept and to remember.
It has no relation to any other fact. So at least it was
forty years ago, as I and my contemporaries can testify.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> But
<i>Jovis</i>, although it can not be derived from Jupiter may be derived
from or at least connected with <i>Zeus</i>. In fact it is so derived
or connected. The supreme god of the Latin and the
Greek mythology was the same god, and he had originally the
same name, which was Dyus, or some like form. But the Latins
did not derive this personage of their mythology <i>from</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Greeks, nor take his name from them, as it was once assumed
they did. This is shown by the name they gave him, <i>Jupiter</i>;
yet that very name, unlike as it is to <i>Zeus</i>, and impossible to
be derived from it, has in it the witness of identity of origin.
The fact is that the Latins and the Greeks derived both their
conception of the supreme god and his name from a common
source; a fact which has been revealed by the discovery of
Sanskrit.</p>

<p>In the mythology of the Vedas, the sacred books of the
Brahmins, which are written in Sanskrit, the supreme god, the
<i>primum mobile</i> of divine power is <i>Dyaus</i>, which is from the
root <i>dyu</i>, meaning to beam, to emit light. Dyaus is therefore
the sky god, a record and an expression of the recognition
of divinity in the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> So both to the Greeks and the
Latins the supreme divinity was originally the sky god. Now,
<i>Dyaus</i> and <i>Zeus</i> are the same word with little phonetic modification.
But whence comes <i>Jupiter</i>? Hence. We have seen above
that the Sanskrit word for father is <i>pitri</i>, which seems to be corrupted
from <i>pàtri</i>, a protector,<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> and the simple union of these
two words gives us, <i>Dyaus-patri</i>, which, as an earlier, if not an
original form, of <i>Zeus-pater</i>, or <i>Ju-piter</i>, would be an unexceptional
etymology. We are however not left to conjecture
nor to etymological construction for the origin of
this name; for, according to Max Müller, in the Veda <i>Dyaushpitar</i>
or <i>Dyupitar</i> become almost as much one word as
Jupiter in Latin. Here we have the otherwise anomalous
Latin <i>Jupiter</i> completely accounted for, not only in accordance
with etymology and reason, but by positive historical evidence.
To the Latins <i>Jupiter</i> was merely a name, coming to
them they knew not whence nor how; but they had received it in
a direct line of communication from their Aryan forefathers, who
were also the forefathers of the writers of the Sanskrit Vedas.
Yet more; when the Roman said <i>Jupiter</i> he merely called his
supreme god the Heavenly Father. So near, in the very idea
of divinity, does the evidence found in the history of language
bring the modern Christian to the primitive pagan.</p>

<p>This name <i>Dyaus</i>, or <i>Zeus</i>, is also regarded by some of the
most eminent philologists as identical with the name of the
Eddic god Tyr and the Saxon word Tiw, and as present in our
<i>Tues</i>-day or <i>Tiws</i>-daeg. It may be so; but specialists who may
claim submissive deference as to matters of fact within their
specialty are often led by enthusiasm into theory and speculation
which respect for their learning does not oblige us to accept.</p>

<p>But space fails me, and with a brief exposition of a very few
points of my previous paper this one must be closed.</p>

<p>The records of possession left in the names of places by advancing
tribes of Aryans may be well illustrated by two names
more widely known, perhaps, than any other two in the world—Thames
and Avon. Now, both these names mean merely
river, running water. Why, then, do we say the river Thames
and the river Avon; which is merely to say in each case the
river River. Simply because our English (or Anglo-Saxon)
forefathers going to England and conquering it, found those
streams so called by the natives. In the old Welsh (Celtic)
which was spoken in ancient Britain both <i>tam</i> or <i>tama</i> and <i>afon</i>
mean a river, and the rude and simple people naturally called
the running water nearest them merely the river. When there
was but one theater in London, and when there was but one in
New York, in each case it was called merely the theater, without
any other name, which indeed was needless. But when
the Anglo-Saxons heard the stream on which London stands
called <i>tam</i>, and that on which Stratford stands called <i>afon</i>,
those words did not mean running water to them; they were
mere names; and names they have remained. There are no
less than nine rivers in England called Avon (merely because
they were <i>the</i> river to the old Britons in their neighborhood);
and <i>tam</i> is found in composition in names of places (Tamworth,
Tamarton) with the same meaning. The Celts have left
these name-traces upon hills, forests, and streams, not only in
England, but all over southern and western Europe. Other
families have left similar vestiges. A moderate illustration of
this one point would require a paper by itself. In this way the
march and the dwelling places of the principal divisions of the
great race can be discovered.</p>

<p>It was said in the foregoing paper that the development and the
various stages of knowledge attained by the Aryans had left
traces in the history of their language; and it was remarked
that the facts that words for boat and oars are common to all
the languages of the race, while those which pertain to navigation
are radically unlike, shows that before the great separation
took place, the Aryans had rowed small boats on rivers, but
knew nothing of ships and deep-sea sailing. From similar
evidence we infer that they never saw salt water before the
separation; for at that time they did not know the oyster, which
is found in the Caspian Sea. The name <i>oyster</i> is common to
all the European peoples, ancient as well as modern (Latin <i>ostrea</i>,
Greek <i>ostreon</i>, with the meaning bone, shell); but in Sanskrit
the word for the much eaten bivalve is <i>pushtika</i>. Plainly
the southeastern moving and the northwestern moving Aryans
severally named the oyster after they had parted. It is also
remarkable that the only tree of which the name is common to
all the Indo-European peoples, Asiatic as well as European, is
the birch; the name of which in Sanskrit is <i>bhúrja</i> (observe how
like in sound the two words are); and that this tree is the most
widely dispersed of all the forest flora, and is found in great
variety and large quantity in Central Asia.</p>

<p>In most of the examples of etymology given in this paper the
likeness between the recent and the remote has been more or
less apparent to eye or ear on slight examination. It must not
however be supposed that the history of a word is limited by
such palpable bounds. On the contrary etymology, which
when trustworthy proceeds step by step accounting for, but
accepting every clearly established change, leads the inquirer
in numberless instances into regions at first far beyond his
ken. One illustrative instance must suffice: The French
word for water is <i>O</i>. It is spelled <i>eau</i>; but that is not to the
purpose; a word is a sound, not the name of an assemblage of
signs called letters. Now this sound <i>O</i>, or <i>eau</i>, comes
directly from the Latin <i>aqua</i>, in which there is no trace of it;
and in which, moreover, there are, as will be seen, sounds of
a marked character which have been wholly swept away.
The course of derivation or degradation was this: <i>Aqua</i> by
the common change of <i>u</i> to <i>v</i>, became <i>aqva</i>, which passed by
phonetic decay into <i>ava</i>, and this by a common vowel change
become <i>eve</i>, which in turn, by a common diphthongal extension,
broadened into <i>eave</i>, the <i>v</i> in which changing back again
into <i>u</i> gave <i>eaue</i>, of which the body, <i>au</i>, came to represent the
whole word, which at last reached the simple vowel sound <i>o</i>.
In like manner the Greek <i>pente</i>, the French <i>cinq</i>, the English
<i>five</i>, and the Sanskrit <i>pancan</i> may all be traced to the same
root, <i>pani</i>, the hand, with its five fingers; the English <i>tooth</i>
and the Latin <i>dens</i> are from the same root (indeed it has been
extracted), and so are <i>coucher</i> and <i>locus</i>, and even <i>galaxy</i> and
<i>lettuce</i>. That I may not seem to tantalize my reader I will
give the easy explanation of the last paradox-like assertion.
The bond between the two words is in the Latin word for milk,
<i>lac</i>, and the kindred Greek word for the same fluid, <i>gala</i>; the
old forms having been severally <i>lact</i> and <i>galact</i>. The galaxy
is the milky-way, and lettuce is the juicy, milky plant; the
Old French name of which (from which ours comes) was
<i>laictuce</i>, which itself represented the Latin <i>lactuca</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The reader having now seen some few characteristic illustrations
of the methods, the course, and the revelations of
philology in regard to the language of the Aryan peoples, we
are ready to examine the history and the structure of English.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Here and elsewhere I use italic letters to spell a Greek word; doing so because it
is quite possible that many intelligent and inquiring readers who may look to me, as
to a fellow-student, for a little help, may be unacquainted with the Greek alphabet,
and the force of its various characters. We are obliged to use this letter in Russian
and Sanskrit; why not in Greek? As to that however there is one notable and often
recurring difficulty in the use of an alien alphabet: the short <i>e</i> is one letter, <i>epsilon</i>,
and the long <i>e</i> another, <i>eta</i> (pronounced <i>aytah</i>). The sound and value of the latter
is that of the French or Italian <i>e</i>; that is the name sound of English <i>a</i>, without the
slight <i>e</i> sound, with which we close it. This sound—the long <i>e</i> (or <i>a</i>)—I have
endeavored to indicate by using for it a Roman letter. Strictness would demand
other like indications of sound which must be passed by with this allusion.</p>

<h3>WATER.—PHYSICAL PROPERTIES.</h3>

<p>A glance at the map of our earth at once reveals the preponderance
of water. Three-fourths of its surface is covered
by the ocean, and if we divide the globe into northeastern and
southwestern halves, one of the hemispheres will consist almost
entirely of water. Yet there was a time when the ocean
was still more extensive and covered islands and continents;
even the loftiest mountain peaks were beneath the sea. We
shall presently see how important an agency water became in
moulding the earth and making it habitable for man. The
lakes and rivers also constitute no small part of many lands,
and even in the air, invisible streams are ever flowing, for
“all the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
the place from whence the rivers come thither they return
again.” The summer’s heat is the power, and the air its
instrument, by which vapors, fogs, clouds and rain are lifted
and borne back to the mountains and again scattered over the
plains.</p>

</div>

<h4>WATER AS AN ARCHITECT—WORLD-BUILDING.</h4>

<p>In the divine hand water has been used as the material with
which to shape the earth, even as a workman employs his
files, emery and diamond dust to shape the objects upon
which he labors. At first the earth was characterized by one
dead level—a wide, desolate, fire-scarred plain; then the
mountains were upheaved, the depths were broken up, and,
no longer resting in their quiet beds, everywhere rolled down
the slopes, and by mere attrition, wore away the firm rocks
and bore the material into the plains below; all valleys have
thus been made. Some are still in process of formation. Far
out in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Indian Ocean, the Mississippi
and the Ganges are pouring their sediment and building
future continents. Sometimes, where the volume of water
was great, or the mountains steep, mighty gorges were carved
out, like the river-bed below Niagara, the tremendous cuts of
the Congo, or the awful cañons of the Colorado, some of which
are five thousand feet in depth. Ceaseless waves beat upon
the shore, powdered the rocks, and made the soft beaches;
tides ebbed and flowed, and slowly wrought their changes.
In addition to the <i>wearing</i> action of the water, which arises
from the smoothness of its molecules, and the slight cohesion
of its particles, thereby causing ceaseless motion, it possesses
a wonderful solvent power. Solution arises from the fact that
the adhesion between a liquid and a solid is greater than the
cohesion between the molecules of the solid; whenever this is
the case the latter will be dissolved. If water is heated, this
action will be intensified; such was its condition in the early
geologic ages, and this explains the extraordinary rapidity
with which rocks were then dissolved. Beautiful grottoes were
formed like that of Antiparos, vast caverns, such as those
along the coasts of Scotland, the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky,
and the Wyandotte of Indiana. It is a curious paradox which
appears in this story of world-building that the New World
was really the oldest in process of formation, and that the
tallest mountains were the latest upheaved.</p>

<h4>WATER AS AN ARTIST.</h4>

<p>If we will stop and remember for a moment how often the
painter and poet dwell upon <i>variety</i> in landscapes, we shall
appreciate more fully the artistic work of water. We have already
seen that by dissolving the rocks, the way was prepared
for all verdure, and not less truly did it round the hills and
carve the gorges, as well as smooth the outlines, which add so
much to nature’s charms. Nor is this all. In the running
brook, the sparkling cascade, the white foam of the cataract,
the deep blue of the sea, the matchless variety and beauty of
the clouds, we may behold the grandest exhibitions of color
and form. There is endless variation in the tint, light and
shade of water, owing to many causes. That this is true one
will easily see in studying Church’s “Icebergs,” a picture of
wonderful color and beauty, although one would scarcely expect
these qualities in such a subject. Time would fail to describe
the numberless forms of beauty displayed by water; it
glitters in the dewdrop, shimmers in the wave, rounds the
cheek of beauty, colors the rose, and paints the rainbow on
the arching sky.</p>

<h4>WATER AS A LABORER.</h4>

<p>Water was early made to labor for man. Of the various
forms of energy which he employs, animal, steam, electricity,
wind, water, the last is probably the most inexpensive. It is
a singular fact that all national progress and efficiency have
depended largely upon proximity of water. Seas, indenting
bays, sounds, rivers early bore the commerce of the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
formed the medium for interchange of ideas, inventions, arts
and literature. The little peninsulas of Italy and Greece, with
their broken coast-line, developed a hardy race of seamen,
who penetrated to the remotest parts of the then known
world. The story of the Argonauts in search of the Golden
Fleece is one of the earliest, as it is one of the most beautiful
traditions of antiquity.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus015a.jpg" width="400" height="260" alt="" />
<p class="caption">CAPILLARY ATTRACTION—WATER AND QUICKSILVER.</p>
</div>

<p>Look at that sturdy little island in the north Atlantic, whose
people have so utilized the ocean that “she has dotted the surface
of the whole globe with her possessions and military
posts, whose morning drum beat, following the sun and keeping
company with the hours, circles the earth daily with one
continuous strain of the martial airs of England.” We build
many hopes for the prosperity of our own country upon the
fact of our extensive coast-line, which gives us one mile of
shore-line to every one hundred and four square miles of surface,
while that of Europe, which is far more favored in this
respect than any other division of the world, has only one mile
of coast for every two hundred and twenty-four square miles
of surface. Water furnishes the most convenient and mobile
instrument for applying gravity. As it flows on its way to the
sea, everywhere it is made to turn the thousand busy wheels
of industry, so that it used to be said that every pound of water
in the Blackstone and Merrimac rivers did a pound of work
before it reached the sea. The physical property of water
which makes it in this connection so useful is, that it presses
equally in all directions; it can therefore be adjusted with
great ease to the sinuosities of tubes, water-wheels and kindred
appliances. We also use it as a convenient power for
obtaining pressure by means of the hydrostatic press.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus015b.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE HYDROSTATIC PRESS—PRESSING COTTON.</p>
</div>

<p>This depends upon the principle that water transmits force
equally in all directions; therefore, strange as it may appear, we
meet the paradox that a little water will accomplish as much as a
great quantity. Thus, if a slender upright tube be connected
with the bottom of a large tank the water will stand at the
same height in both, and consequently the trifling amount of
water in the tube supports and balances the vast amount in
the tank. Suppose the area of the tube were as one to ten
thousand. Now, if we should apply the force of one pound on
the surface of the water in the tube, an uplifting force of one
pound would be communicated to every equal area of a piston
resting upon the surface of the water in the tank; so it is evident
that with the pressure of one pound we might raise ten
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>There are few more interesting proofs that “Peace hath her
victories, no less renowned than war,” than that found in the
completion of the Erie Canal, whereby a path was made for
the vast agricultural products of the west to the metropolis,
and thence to all countries.</p>

<p>Re-read the story of that magnificent commemoration of human
genius and effort, when, in New York harbor, Governor
DeWitt Clinton joined in perpetual wedlock the lake and the
sea.</p>

<p>An interesting illustration of the upward pressure of water
in seeking its level may often be seen in the dry docks of our
great seaport cities, where old ocean is frequently compelled
to do heavy work for man by lifting his ships out of water. A
vessel is on the shoals; after the storm has subsided a great
number of empty air-tight casks are sunk around the ship and
fastened to it. The gradual pushing of the water lifting against
the casks slowly raises the vessel until she floats.</p>

<h4>WATER AS A LAPIDARY.</h4>

<p>Allusion has already been made to the erosive action of water.
Every day observation will furnish us examples of this.
The pebbles beneath our feet have been rounded and polished
by this lapidary. The most beautiful specimens of its handiwork,
however, are to be found in crystallization. Snow exhibits
many lovely forms. If the flakes are caught on any dark
surface we shall readily see that they are fashioned with great
symmetry, starlike in form, on the plan of six diverging rays.
There is an endless variety formed by additions made to these
primaries. Not less beautiful are many of the forms of ice.
The Mer-de-Glace of the Alps is pronounced by Prof. Tyndall
one of nature’s most resplendent pieces of handiwork. If we
may judge from all descriptions, the lofty spires and glittering
sides of an iceberg furnish a spectacle sublime and terrible.
The vast ice fields of the North, in spite of all their desolation,
possess a mysterious charm.</p>

<p>The most favorable condition for the crystallization of any
substance is its solution in water. It will thus appear that water
is one great source of that marvelous beauty of form which
we find in the mineral world. This process of nature may
readily be repeated by dissolving alum, sugar, and similar
substances, and crystallizing them on glass, or a string placed
in the solution, and allowed to remain undisturbed. Bouquets
of crystallized grasses are made in this way, often being colored
afterward.</p>

<p>Almost all mineral substances can be crystallized, and some
of the finest observations of the microscopist are made upon
these objects.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting phenomena produced are those
of polarized light, and many important deductions in medicine
and chemistry are derived therefrom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h4>WATER AS A FARMER.</h4>

<p>Solids are not the only substances which water is capable of
taking to itself. Gases are also absorbed by it. A pint of water
under one pressure of the atmosphere will absorb one pint
of carbonic acid. It will take seven hundred pints of ammonia
gas. This power of absorption belonging to water is of
the greatest importance to agriculture. As the rain descends
it frees the air from noxious gases, and carries them to the
earth, where they are distributed to the rootlets of the plants;
in this instance that which is death to the animal is life to the
plant; it also rises in all vegetation, from cell to cell, by what
is known as endosmosis. It moves freely through the porous
earth by capillary attraction, the interstices of the earth really
constituting a system of tubing through which the liquids freely
circulate. When the earth becomes compact and hard the water
can not so freely move through it; if the weather is dry,
then follows another important result—the air, which always
bears with it more or less moisture, especially in hot weather,
can not pass through the soil and bring to the roots its gift of
nutrition. Any one can
perform the following experiment:
Walk into the
garden some morning
when the season is dry
and hot. You will often
notice that the garden
walk looks damp, while
the spot that you hoed
the day before, perhaps,
seems dry, but if you will
dig down a little way into
each you will find that the
loosened earth where you
had worked, is moist,
while the former is, below
the surface, quite dry.
Hence a practical inference
of much value—the
importance of frequently
hoeing and loosening the
earth, to facilitate the
growth of plants, especially
when the season is
dry. The philosophy of
this is, that the air freely
passing through the loosened
earth becomes cooled,
and the moisture it
contains is condensed,
and remains to nourish
the plant. A curious illustration
of this fact is
found in the prolific growth of watermelons, which are raised
with the greatest success in dry sand, which is often so hot
on the surface as to be painful to the hand; and yet a
hundred pounds of watermelon contain ninety-eight pounds of
water. The agricultural value of a country depends as much
upon its water supply as upon the excellence of its soil. Here
again we find one of the grandest endowments of “our heritage.”
This is a land of sweet and abundant waters. Even
those portions once considered worthless have been made of
immense value by irrigation. Through our pastures flow crystal
streams for the advantage of the dairy, as the production
of good butter depends as much upon pure water as it does
upon sweet grasses.</p>

<p>Glance over one of the broad corn-fields of the West. What
a wonderful contrivance is each stalk for gathering sunlight
and moisture! Water constitutes eighty per cent. of that vast
growth! The forces of the sunbeam, which are locked up in
it, will be surrendered during the coming winter, to sustain
and invigorate man and beast. Take two large goblets, one
of which is nearly filled with water. Place on it a piece of
card-board, through which a hole has been made, pass through
the opening the roots of any growing plant, like a spray of
bergamot. Cover the plant with the other goblet; in a few
moments the inner surface of the upper goblet will be covered
with moisture, showing that the roots have absorbed and
the stomata or pores of the leaves have exhaled the moisture.
In every land drouth is synonymous with want and famine.
With glad festivals the Egyptians greet the rising of the Nile.
The seven lean years of Joseph’s time were years of drouth.
If M. De Lesseps should carry out his mighty project of overflowing
the Sahara with the waters of the Mediterranean, that
desert may yet bud and blossom like the rose. Growth is intimately
connected with climate, and the latter depends not a
little upon proximity to water. The beautiful lake region of
the United States would be almost uninhabitable were it not
for the gentle influence of these inland seas. They cool the
air in summer and warm it in winter, thus forming a great
equalizing influence and
preventing extremes of
temperature.</p>

<h4>WATER AS PHILANTHROPIST.</h4>

<p>Few things are more
interesting and suggestive
of a kind Providence
than the plan by which
water is supplied to the
human family by underground
currents, where
it is kept cool in summer,
and prevented from
freezing in the winter.
Natural pipeage is found
almost everywhere in the
earth, consisting of a
layer of sand or gravel
found between layers of
clay or rock, which are
practically impervious to
water.</p>

<p>Where the upper layer
is wanting springs appear.
They often gush
from the foot of the hills,
but not unfrequently we
find them on lofty summits.
Human skill has
sought for these hidden
streams at great depths
by means of Artesian
wells, some of which are two thousand feet deep. It is claimed
that the Chinese used them two thousand years ago for procuring
gas and salt water. There is a famous Artesian well at Grenelle,
Paris, which yields six hundred and fifty-six gallons of
water per minute, while two of these wells in Chicago discharge
four hundred and thirty-two thousand gallons a day.
As Chicago is situated on a level prairie, this water must come
from the high hills of Rock River, a hundred miles away. The
water coming from these great depths is warm, one proof of
the heated condition of the interior of the earth.</p>

<p>Horticulturists have in some places conducted this heated
water by underground pipes through their gardens, and thus
produced a semi-tropical vegetation.</p>

<p>Human contrivances for lifting water to higher elevations
are various. Archimedes invented a screw for this purpose.
The siphon, the chain pump, the ordinary lifting pump, the
force pump, and some other inventions are applied to do this
work. It would be a profitable exercise to study out the philosophy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of these water lifters. You can also make them for yourself.
The illustration of the forms of siphons and their various
uses, for example, as given in this article, will well repay careful
study.</p>

<p>Another way in which water acts as a friend to man, is in its
hygienic effects. Think of the numberless uses of ice in summer,
and how grateful to the fevered lips is ice! The invalid
seeks in summer the cool sea breeze, freighted with its finely
divided and stimulating salts and mineral vapors. In winter
the genial atmosphere of Florida or the Gulf will fan the patient’s
faded cheek. Or perhaps some health resort may be
sought where there are mingled with the waters valuable
medicinal restoratives. Vermont has the greatest number of
these, but they are found at Sharon, Avon, Clifton, and Saratoga;
while the hot springs of Arkansas have a great reputation,
and who knows but what in some of the wonderful bath
fountains of the West we may yet find what Ponce de Leon
sought, the elixir which should transform old age into blooming
youth. The latest new idea in medical practice is the hot water
cure, which consists in drinking an indefinite amount of hot
water whenever opportunity makes it possible. Public fountains
are good temperance lectures.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">SELECTED BY CHANCELLOR J. H. VINCENT, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="NOV2">[<i>November 2.</i>]</h3>

<p>We read of Payson, that his mind, at times, almost lost sense
of the external world, in the ineffable thoughts of God’s glory,
which rolled like a sea of light around him, at the throne of
grace.</p>

<p>We read of Cowper, that, in one of the few lucid hours of
his religious life, such was the experience of God’s presence
which he enjoyed in prayer, that, as he tells us, he thought he
should have died with joy, if special strength had not been
imparted to him to bear the disclosure.</p>

<p>We read of one of the Tennents, that on one occasion, when
he was engaged in secret devotion, so overpowering was the
revelation of God which opened upon his soul, and with the
augmenting intensity of effulgence as he prayed, that at length
he recoiled from the intolerable joy as from a pain, and besought
God to withhold from him further manifestations of his
glory. He said, “Shall thy servant <i>see</i> thee and live?”</p>

<p>We read of the “sweet hours” which Edwards enjoyed “on
the banks of Hudson’s River, in secret converse with God,”
and hear his own description of the inward sense of Christ
which at times came into his heart, and which he “knows not
how to express otherwise than by a calm, sweet abstraction of
soul from all the concerns of this world; and sometimes a kind
of vision … of being alone in the mountains, or
some solitary wilderness, far from all mankind, sweetly conversing
with Christ, and rapt and swallowed up in God.”</p>

<p>We read of such instances of the fruits of prayer, in the
blessedness of the suppliant, and are we not reminded by them
of the transfiguration of our Lord, of whom we read, “As he
prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his
raiment was white and glistening?” Who of us is not oppressed
by the contrast between such an experience and his
own? Does not the cry of the patriarch come unbidden to
our lips, “Oh, that I knew where I might find Him?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The scriptural examples of prayer have, most of them, an
unutterable intensity. They are pictures of <i>struggles</i>, in which
more of suppressed desire is hinted than that which is expressed.
Recall the wrestling of Jacob: “I will not let thee
go except thou bless me;” and the “panting” and “pouring
out of soul” of David: “I wail day and night; my throat is
dried: … I wait for my God;” and the importunity
of the Syro-Phœnician woman, with her “Yes, Lord, yet the
dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs;” and the
persistency of Bartimeus, crying out, “the more a great deal,”
“Have mercy on me;” and the strong crying and tears of our
Lord, “If it be possible—if it be possible!” There is no easiness
of desire here. The scriptural examples of prayer, also,
are clear as light in their objects of thought. Even those
which are calm and sweet, like the Lord’s prayer, have few
and sharply-defined subjects of devotion. They are not discursive
and voluminous, like many uninspired forms of supplication.
They do not range over everything at once. They
have no vague expressions; they are crystalline; a child need
not read them a second time to understand them. As uttered
by their authors, they were in no antiquated phraseology; they
were in the fresh forms of a living speech. They were, and
were meant to be, the channels of living thoughts and living
hearts.—<i>Phelps.</i></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="NOV9">[<i>November 9.</i>]</h3>

<p>It is the highest stage of manhood to have no wish, no
thought, no desire, but Christ—to feel that to die were bliss if
it were for Christ—that to live in penury, and woe, and scorn,
contempt, and misery, were sweet for Christ. To feel that it
matters nothing what becomes of one’s self, so that our Master
is but exalted—to feel that though like a sear leaf, we are
blown in the blast, we are quite careless whither we are going,
so long as we feel that the Master’s hand is guiding us according
to his will; or rather, to feel that though like the diamond,
we must be exercised with sharp tools, yet we care not how
sharply we may be cut, so that we may be made brilliants to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
adorn <i>his</i> crown. If any of us have attained to this sweet
feeling of self-annihilation, we shall look up to Christ as if he
were the sun, and we shall say within ourselves, “O Lord, I
see thy beams; I feel myself to be—not a beam from thee—but
darkness, swallowed up in thy light. The most I ask is,
that thou wouldst live in me—that the life I live in the flesh
may not be my life, but thy life in me; that I may say with
emphasis, as Paul did, ‘For me to live is Christ.’” A man
who has attained this high position has indeed “entered into
rest.” To him the praise or the censure of men is alike contemptible,
for he has learned to look upon the one as unworthy
of his pursuit, and the other as beneath his regard. He is
no longer vulnerable since he has in himself no separate sensitiveness,
but has united his whole being with the cause and
person of the Redeemer. As long as there is a particle of
selfishness remaining in us, it will mar our sweet enjoyment
of Christ; and until we get a complete riddance of it, our joy
will never be unmixed with grief. We must dig at the roots
of our selfishness to find the worm which eats our happiness.
The soul of the believer will always pant for this serene condition
of passive surrender, and will not content itself until it
has thoroughly plunged itself into the sea of divine love. Its
normal condition is that of complete dedication, and it esteems
every deviation from such a state as a plague-mark and a
breaking forth of disease. Here, in the lowest valley of self-renunciation,
the believer walks upon a very pinnacle of exaltation;
bowing himself, he knows that he is rising immeasurably
high when he is sinking into nothing, and, falling flat
upon his face, he feels that he is thus mounting to the highest
elevation of moral grandeur.</p>

<p>It is the ambition of most men to absorb others into their
own life, that they may shine more brightly by the stolen rays
of other lights; but it is the Christian’s highest aspiration to
be absorbed into another, and lose himself in the glories of
his Sovereign and Savior. Proud men hope that the names of
others shall but be remembered as single words in their own
long titles of honor; but loving children of God long for nothing
more than to see their own names used as letters in the
bright records of the doings of the Wonderful, the Counselor.—<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3 id="NOV16">[<i>November 16.</i>]</h3>

<p>The peace of Christ, then, was the fruit of the combined
<i>toil</i> and <i>trust</i>, in the one case diffusing itself from the center
of his active life, in the other from his passive emotions;
enabling him in the one case to <i>do things</i> tranquilly, in the
other to <i>see things</i> tranquilly. Two things only can make life
go wrong and painfully with us; when we suffer or suspect
misdirection and feebleness in the energies of love and duty
within us or in the providence of the world without us; bringing,
in the one case, the lassitude of an unsatisfied and discordant
nature; in the other the melancholy of hopeless views.
From these Christ delivers us by a summons to mingled toil
and trust. And herein does his peace differ from that which
“the world giveth”—that its prime essential is not ease, but
strife; not self-indulgence, but self-sacrifice; not acquiescence
in evil for the sake of quiet, but conflict with it for the sake of
God; not, in short, a prudent accommodation of the mind to
the world, but a resolute subjugation of the world to the best
conceptions of the mind. Amply has the promise to leave
behind him such a peace been since fulfilled. It was fulfilled
to the apostles who first received it, and has been realized
again by a succession of faithful men to whom they have delivered
it.</p>

<p>The word “peace” denotes the absence of war and conflict;
a condition free from the restlessness of fruitless desire, the
forebodings of anxiety, the stings of eternity.… The
first impulse of “the natural man” is, to seek peace by mending
his external condition; to quiet desire by increase of ease;
to banish anxiety by increase of wealth; to guard against hostility
by making himself too strong for it; to build up his life
into a future of security and a palace of comfort, where he may
softly lie, though tempests beat and rain descends. The spirit
of Christianity casts away at once this whole theory of peace;
declares it the most chimerical of dreams, and proclaims it impossible
even to make this kind of reconciliation between the
soul and the life wherein it acts. As well might the athlete demand
a victory without a foe. To the noblest faculties of the
soul, rest is disease and torture. The understanding is commissioned
to grapple with ignorance, the conscience to confront
the powers of moral evil, the affections to labor for the wretched
and oppressed; nor shall any peace be found till these, which
reproach and fret us in our most elaborate ease, put forth an
incessant and satisfying energy; till instead of conciliating
the world, we vanquish it; and rather than sit still, in the sickness
of luxury, for it to amuse our perceptions, we precipitate
ourselves upon it to mould it into a new creation. Attempt to
make all smooth and pleasant without, and you thereby create
the most corroding of anxieties, and stimulate the most insatiable
of appetites within. But let there be harmony within, let
no clamors of self drown the voice which is entitled to authority
there, let us set forth on the mission of duty, resolved to
live for it alone, to close with every resistance that obstructs it,
and march through every field that awaits it, and in the consciousness
of immortal power, the sense of ill will vanish; and
the peace of God well nigh extinguish the sufferings of the
man. “In the world we may have tribulation; in Christ we
shall have peace.”—<i>James Martineau.</i></p>

<h3 id="NOV23">[<i>November 23.</i>]</h3>

<p>God is love; he who does not love him does not know him;
for how can we know love without loving?… God who
made all things in fact creates us anew every moment. It did
not follow necessarily that because we were yesterday, we
should exist to-day; we might cease to be, we might relapse
into the nothingness from whence we came, if the same all-powerful
hand who called us from it did not still sustain us.
We are nothing in ourselves; we are only what God has made
us to be, and that only while it pleases him. He has only to
withdraw the hand which supports us in order to replunge us
into the abyss of our nothingness, as a stone which one holds
in the air falls from its own weight, as soon as the hand is unclosed
which supports it. Thus do we hold existence only as
the continual gift of God.…</p>

<p>It is not to know thee, oh God, to regard thee only as an all-powerful
being who gives laws to all nature, and who has created
everything which we see, it is only to know a part of thy
being, it is not to know that which is most wonderful and most
affecting to thy rational offspring. That which transports and
melts my soul is to know that thou art the God of my heart.
Thou doest there thy good pleasure.… Oh God! man
does not know thee, he knows not who thou art. “The light
shines in the midst of the darkness, but the darkness comprehendeth
it not.” It is through thee that we live, that we think,
that we enjoy the pleasures of life, and we forget him from
whom we receive all these things.</p>

<p>Universal light! it is through thee alone that we see anything.
Sun of the soul, who dost shine more brightly than the
material sun! seeing nothing except through thee we see not
thee thyself. It is thou who givest all things, to the stars their
light, to the fountains their waters and their courses, to the
earth its plants, to the fruits their flavor, to all nature its riches
and its beauty, to man health, reason, virtue, thou givest all,
thou doest all, thou rulest over all; I see only thee, all other
things vanish as a shadow before him who has once seen thee.
But alas! he who has not seen thee, has seen nothing, he has
passed his life in the illusion of a dream; he is as if he were
not more unhappy still, for as we learn from thy word, it were
better for him if he had not been born.</p>

<p>For myself I ever find thee within me. It is thee who workest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
with me in all the good I do. I have felt a thousand times
that I could not of myself conquer my passions, overcome my
habits, subdue my pride, follow my reason, or continue to will
what I have once willed. It is thou who gavest me this will,
who preservest it pure; without thee I am like a reed, agitated
by the wind. Thou hast given me courage, uprightness, and
all the good emotions which I experience. Thou hast created
within me a new heart which desires thy justice, and thirsts for
thy eternal truth. I leave myself in thy hands; it is enough
for me to fulfill thy all-beneficent designs, and in nothing to
resist thy good pleasure, for which I was created. Command,
forbid, what willest thou that I should do? What that I should
do? Lifted up, cast down, comforted, left to suffer, employed
in thy service, or useless to every one, I still adore thee, ever
yielding my will, I say with Mary, “Be it unto me according
to thy word.”—<i>Fénelon.</i></p>

<h3 id="NOV30">[<i>November 30.</i>]</h3>

<p>Remember what St. Paul saith, “Our life is hid with Christ
in God.” … Five cordial observations are couched
therein. First, that God sets a high price and valuation on the
souls of his servants, in that he is pleased to hide them; none
will hide toys and trifles, but what is counted a treasure. Secondly,
the word hide, as a relative, imports that some seek
after our souls, being none other than Satan himself, that roaring
lion, who goes about seeking whom he may devour. But the
best is, let him seek, and seek, and seek, till all his malice be
weary (if that be possible), we can not be hurt by him whilst
we are hid in God. Thirdly, grant Satan find us there, he can
not fetch us thence; our souls are bound in the bundle of life,
with the Lord our God. So that, be it spoken with reverence,
God must first be stormed with force or fraud, before the soul
of a saint sinner, hid in him, can be surprised. Fourthly, we
see the reason why so many are at a loss, in the agony of a
wounded conscience, concerning their spiritual estate: for they
look for their life in a wrong place, namely, to find it in their
own piety, purity, and inherent righteousness. But though
they seek, and search, and dig, and dive never so deep, all in
vain. For though Adam’s life was hid in himself, and he intrusted
with the keeping of his own integrity, yet, since Christ’s
coming, all the original evidences of our salvation are kept in
a higher office, namely, hidden in God himself. Lastly, as our
English proverb saith, “He that hid can find;” so God (to
whom belongs the issues from death) can infallibly find out
that soul that is hidden in him, though it may seem, when
dying, even to labor to lose itself in a fit of despair.…</p>

<p>Surely as Joseph and Mary conceived that they had lost
Christ in a crowd and sought him three days sorrowing, till at
last they found him, beyond their expectation, safe and sound,
sitting in the temple; so many pensive parents, solicitous for
the souls of their children, have even given them up for gone,
and lamented them lost (because dying without visible comfort),
and yet, in due time, shall find them, to their joy and
comfort, safely possessed of honor and happiness, in the
midst of the heavenly temple and church triumphant in glory.—<i>Fuller.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.—THE GREEK—HIS PROPERTY.</h3>

<p>All Greek property was divided both according to its use,
and also according to its nature. If it was such as merely
produced enjoyment to the owner it was called idle; if it was
directly profitable, it was called useful or fruitful. But this
distinction is less often mentioned than that into <i>visible</i> and
<i>invisible</i> property, which nearly corresponded to our division
into <i>real</i> and <i>personal</i> property. But the Greeks included
ready money, lodged at a banker’s, as a part of real property.
Its principal kind, however, was of course landed property, as
well as town houses, country farms, and sometimes mining
property held under perpetual lease from the state. Of all
these public accounts were kept, and when special taxes were
required they were paid on this kind of property and according
to this estimate. Personal or invisible property consisted
of all movables, such as furniture, factories, changes of raiment,
cattle, and above all slaves, who were employed in
trades as well as in household work. In days of war and
of heavy taxing it was common for the Greeks to “make away
with” their property, which then meant, not to spend it, but to
make it invisible property, that is, invisible to the state, and
therefore not taxable.</p>

<p>At every epoch of Greek history land was considered the
best and the most important kind of wealth, and the landholder
enjoyed privileges and rights not allowed to other men,
however rich. This arose from the early form of Greek
society. It is clear in Homer that the nobles possess the
greater part of the land as their private property, and much of
even the kings’ wealth was made up of estates. These were
also presented to public benefactors and other distinguished
persons. What land was possessed by the common people
can only be judged from Hesiod, who describes what we
should call tenant farming—the occupying of small pieces of
land in poverty, without telling us whether it was freehold or
rented from the nobles. It was probably the former, at least
in Bœotia, where we can imagine the rough slopes unoccupied
of old as they now are, or covered with trees. These farms
could be held by any one who had the perseverance to clear
and till them. In later days, when aristocracies prevailed,
they also took for themselves the lands, so much so that at
Syracuse and elsewhere they were called “the land-sharers” as
opposed to laborers and tradespeople. In some states, such
as Sparta, it was said that the nobles, or conquering race,
divided the land so as to leave the greater portion in equal
lots for themselves to be worked by their slaves or dependants,
and a smaller portion to the former owners, who were obliged
to pay a rent to the state. But of course no such equality of
lots, if ever carried out, could last. In all states we find the
perpetual complaint that property had come into the hands of
a few, while the many were starving. The Athenians met this
complaint by allotting the lands of islands and coasts which
they conquered among their poorer citizens, who retained their
rights at Athens while holding their foreign possessions.</p>

<p>Land was either bare or arable land, or planted with trees.
There were also stony mountain pastures. In historical days,
all these lands were either let by the state on leases, usually
for ever (as was especially the case with mines), or were similarly
let by political and religious corporations, or were worked
by private owners for their own benefit by means of stewards
and slaves. Such country farms are often mentioned in lists
of property by the orators. The main produce has already
been described. We have no means of fixing the value of
landed property in Greece, as we generally hear of prices
without being told of the amount of land in question. But the
low average of the actual prices mentioned in Attica points to
a great subdivision of such property.</p>

<p>As was before observed, the older Greek houses built in narrow
irregular streets were of little value, being very plain and
without any ornament. Leotychides, who was king of Sparta
in B. C. 500, could not contain his wonder at a ceiling paneled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
in wood, which he saw at Corinth, and Demosthenes tells us
that the houses of the most celebrated Athenians at the same
period were so modest as to be in no way different from those
of their neighbors. Such houses, which remained the ordinary
fashion all through Greek history, were of course not very valuable,
and we hear of one worth only three minæ (about $60
of our money), of another at Eleusis worth five, and Demosthenes
speaks of what he calls a little house worth seven
(about $140). But we know that Alcibiades and other fashionable
men of his time began to decorate their houses with
paintings—a fashion which became quite common at Tanagra
later on; this and other improvements raised the price of some
houses to forty or fifty minæ, and the rich banker, Pasion, possessed
one which was let in lodgings and which was rated
at one hundred.</p>

<p>All these prices are very low when compared with our standard,
and can only be explained by the fact that at Athens,
which was probably the most crowded and the dearest place
in Greece, the circuit of the walls was greater than that required
for the houses, so that there was always building ground
to spare. It appears that Athenian citizens did not invest
more than the fifth part of their property in dwelling houses,
unless they kept them for letting out. The ordinary rent of
country houses in Attica was from eight to eight and three-quarters
per cent. of the total value, which is about the same
that a builder now expects for the money he invests in houses.
But when we reflect that the ordinary rate of interest was not
five per cent. as among us, but twelve, we have another proof
that houses and house-rent were cheap in Greece. But we
should also remember the fact that as most of the day was
spent abroad, the house was by no means so important as it is
in our colder and harsher climate.</p>

<p>As to the other kinds of real property, that which we know
most about, and which was perhaps the most important, was
mining property. There were gold and silver mines in many
parts of Greece, of which those of Thasos (gold) and Laurium
(silver) are the best known. Both these were probably discovered
by the Phœnicians. We are told that the Athenian state
used to let the right of mining on leases for ever, for a fine at
the outset, of which we can not tell the amount, and a rent of
four per cent. on the profit. The shafts in pits were thus
divided into lots, and the holder of the lease could sell it, or
borrow money upon it, just as upon any other real property.
Owing to the fixed yearly rent or tax upon the produce of the
mine, the occasional taxes were not levied on this kind of
property. There were officers appointed to watch the working
of the mines and see that the rent was honestly paid, just as
we have government officers constantly supervising distilleries,
in order to see the taxes properly paid. The produce of the
mines of Laurium was a great source of wealth to Athens; just
as the gold mines of Thrace were an important gain to Philip
of Macedon. This was especially the case, because they were
worked not by free labor, which is subject to strikes and the
raising of wages, but by slaves bought and hired out for that
purpose.</p>

<p>By far the most important part of personal property was the
possession of slaves and of ready money. There is indeed
some doubt among Greek writers about the classing of the latter,
and generally we find the money left by a citizen in bank
counted as a part of his real property in the law courts.
There can be no doubt that gold and silver were very scarce
in Greece up to the time of the Persian wars, the first large
quantities being presents from the Lydian and other Asiatic
kings. Even in later days great fortunes were not frequent,
and the Greeks always kept much of their wealth invested in
slaves and in vessels of gold and silver or plate, as we should
call it. These latter are always specially mentioned in inventories
of property, and the ready money seems always a
small fraction of the full value in these lists. States, on the
other hand, kept large reserve funds of ready money, because
of this general scarcity of it among private citizens, and the
difficulty of borrowing it during a sudden crisis. Accordingly
the ordinary rate of interest obtained on money was twelve
per cent., which was of course greatly increased when the investment
was risky. Thus it was very common to lend money
to a ship-owner in order to enable him to lay in a cargo, and
carry it to a foreign port. But as the money was lost if the
ship foundered the lender expected twenty-five or thirty per
cent. in case of its safe return. We are told that most of the
trade in the Piræus was carried on in this way. Investments
on the security of landed property, or of an established trade,
were, of course, safer, and therefore made at a lower rate of
interest.</p>

<p>The oldest banks in Greece had been the temples, in which
all manner of valuables were deposited for safety. The priests
had also been in the habit of lending money, especially to
states, upon public security. But in later days we find banking,
especially at Athens, altogether a matter of private speculation.
Originally, the table of a money-changer was a
banking office, and there accounts were kept in books by
careful and regular entries. These private bankers often
failed, and such failure was politely called <i>rearranging his
table</i>. There was once an Athenian banker called Pasion,
who had been originally a slave, but who received the freedom
of the city, and was enrolled in one of the most important
<i>demes</i>, because his bank had stood firm when all the
rest failed, and he had thus sustained the public credit. We
are told that letters from his house gave a man credit when
traveling through all the Greek waters, as all the merchants
had dealings with him, and he doubtless issued circular
notes, like those of Coutts’s and other English banks, for the
benefit of travelers.</p>

<p>Of the coinage of money I will speak hereafter. Though
the Phœnicians, especially at Carthage, had invented the use
of token money, like our notes, such a device was, as a rule,
unknown to the Greeks, who did not advance beyond the use
of formal bonds for the payment of money. We are told however
that the people of Byzantium used iron money in this way.</p>

<p>It is difficult for us to put ourselves in the place of the ancients
as regards slaves. They were looked upon strictly as
part of the chattels of the house, on a level rather with horses
and oxen than with human beings. No Greek philosopher,
however humane, had the least idea of objecting to slavery in
itself, which was, Aristotle thought, quite necessary and natural
in all society; but there were Greeks who objected to
other Greeks being enslaved and thought that only barbarians
should be degraded to this condition. Hence, any Greek
general who sold his prisoners of war as slaves, was not indeed
thought guilty of any crime or injustice, but was sometimes
considered to have acted harshly. Still a vast number of
Greeks who might have been brought up in luxury and refinement,
were doomed to this misfortune, in early days, by the
kidnapping of pirates, as Homer often tells us; in later,
through the many fierce civil wars; in both, by being taken up
as foundlings, since the exposing of children was common, and
most states allowed the finder to bring up such infants as his
slaves. Frequently the men of captured cities were massacred,
but in almost all cases the women and children were sold into
slavery. There were some parts of Greece, such as Laconia
and Thessaly, in which old conquered nations were enslaved
under the conditions of what we call serfdom. They were
attached to the land of their master, and supported themselves
by it, paying him a very large rent out of the produce. These
serfs, called by many names, <i>helots</i> at Sparta, <i>penestæ</i> in Thessaly,
<i>clarotæ</i> in Crete, were also obliged in most places to attend
their masters as light-armed soldiers in war. That they
were subject to much injustice and oppression is clear from
the fact that they repeatedly made fierce and dangerous insurrections,
and a writer on the Athenian state significantly complains
that such was the license allowed at Athens to slaves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
that they actually went about dressed almost like free men, and
showed neither fear nor cringing when met in the streets.</p>

<p>Still, though slaves were on the whole better treated at Athens
than elsewhere, they were always liable to torture in case their
evidence was required, as it was common for the accused to
offer his slaves’ evidence if he was suspected of concealing
any facts which they knew, and they were not believed without
torture. So also the respectable and pious Nicias let them out
by thousands to be worked in the Laurian silver mines, where
the poisonous smoke and the hardships were such that half the
price of the slave was paid yearly by the contractor who hired
them—in other words, if they lived three years Nicias received
one and a half times the value of his slaves. The contractor
was also obliged to restore them the same <i>in number</i>, no regard
being had of the individual slave. Again, we find women
slaves deliberately employed by their masters in the worst
kinds of traffic. The general price of slaves was not high,
and seems to have averaged about two minæ (under $40); even
in the case of special accomplishments it did not often exceed
ten minæ. They wore a tunic with one sleeve, and a fur cap,
in fact the dress of the lower class country people.</p>

<p>The most important domestic animal in Greece, as in the rest
of Europe, was the horse. Among the Homeric nobles, who
went both to war and to travel in chariots, the use of horses was
very great, and one Trojan chief is said to have possessed a
drove of three thousand. And yet their carts were drawn by
mules. In later days, the use of chariots in war and carriages
in traveling almost disappeared from Greece, and was practiced
only in Asia Minor. I suppose this was owing to the
scarcity and bad state of the roads. Cavalry and pack horses
were used instead, and the cavalry of most Greek states was
very trifling. The Athenians, for example, had no cavalry at
all at Marathon; and at Platæa none which could even protect
foragers from the Persians, as the Thessalians were not on the
Greek side. The Lacedæmonians had no cavalry at all before
the year 424 B. C. Thus horses (except in Thessaly and a
few other places) were only kept for cavalry purposes, and also
for such displays as the Olympic games and the state processions
in religious festivals. At Athens to keep horses and to
drive four-in-hand (in public contests only) was a proof of either
great wealth or great extravagance. The knights or cavalry
were of the richest class, and only kept one horse each as a
state duty. We know that the very cheapest price for a bad
horse was three minæ—that is to say, more than the average
for a good slave, though not in itself a large sum. Twelve
minæ seems about the average price for an ordinary horse. The
enormous and perfectly exceptional sum of thirteen talents is
said to have been paid for Alexander’s horse “Bucephalus.”
This name was one used of a special breed called <i>ox-headed</i>,
from their short and broad head and neck, and which were
celebrated in Thessaly. Other good breeds came from Sicyon,
Cyrene, and Sicily.</p>

<p>For draught purposes and for traveling with packs, much
greater use was made of mules and donkeys, especially of the
former, as is still the case all over Greece. We have no certain
knowledge as to the prices given for these animals. The
history of the use of oxen is, on the other hand, much better
known. In Homeric times, and before the use of coined
money, prices were fixed by the number of oxen a thing would
cost, and this old practice is preserved in the Latin word <i>pecunia</i>
(from <i>pecus</i>) for money, and in the English <i>fee</i>.</p>

<p>But according as men, and with them farming, increased, so
much land was withdrawn from pasture that few more oxen
were kept than what were wanted for field work and for sacrifices.
Beef was thought heavy diet, except in Bœotia; and
cow’s milk was never much liked by the Greeks. In out-of-the-way
parts of Greece, such as Eubœa and Epirus, there were still
large herds, and this was also the case about Orchomenus; but
in general we hear that hides and even cattle were imported
from the Black Sea and from Cyrene. The price of an ox at
Athens in Solon’s time is said to have been five drachmæ (one
dollar), though much more was sometimes given. This was
not so much on account of the plenty or cheapness of oxen,
as owing to the scarcity of coined money all through Greece.
Accordingly about the year 400 B. C. we find the price greatly
increased, and ranging from fifty to eighty drachmæ. An ox
fit for a prize at games was valued at one hundred ($15.50).</p>

<p>We are told that in Solon’s days an ox was worth five sheep, but
probably in later days the difference was greater, for while oxen
became scarce, the feeding of sheep and goats must at all times
have been a very common employment throughout Greece.
Even in the present day, the traveler can see that from a country
for the most part Alpine, with steep ravines and cliffs and
wild upland pastures, unfit for culture and difficult of access,
no other profit could ever be derived. But now, in the day of
its desolation, shepherds with their flocks of sheep and goats
have invaded many rich districts, once the scene of good and
prosperous agriculture.</p>

<p>The old Greek peasant dressed in sheepskins, made clothes
of the wool, used the milk for cheese and the lambs for feasting
and sacrifice. We hear of no importing of wool into
Greece, but find that the Ionian colonies in Asia Minor, such
as Miletus and Laodicea, were most celebrated for fine woolen
garments, which they made of the wool of the flocks of Mysia
and Phrygia. Many districts all over Greece were also famed
for their woolen stuffs, so much so that the woolen cloaks of
Pallene were given as prizes to victors in some of the local games.
Perhaps Arcadia has remained the least changed part of
Greece in this and in other respects. Even now the shepherds
go up in summer with great flocks to the snowy heights of Cyllene,
and live like Swiss peasants in <i>châlets</i> during the hot
weather. In winter they come down to the warm pastures of
Argos and Corinth, where a tent of skins under an old olive
tree affords them sufficient shelter, with a hedged-in inclosure
protected by fierce dogs for their flocks. Such inclosures and
even stalls are mentioned in Homer.</p>

<p>The price of a sheep at Athens in the fourth century B. C.
seems to have varied from ten to twenty drachmæ, its chief
value being the quality of the wool. There is nothing very
special known about goats, which were kept, as they now are,
very much in the same way as sheep, and their hair used for
making ropes and coarse stuffs.</p>

<p>In the same way we know little of pigs beyond that their
hides were used for rough coats, and that Homer’s heroes were
very fond of pork. We hear of large droves being kept in the
mountainous parts of Arcadia, Laconia, and Ætolia, where
they fed on the acorns in the oak woods. Fowls were not a
usual article of diet, and are therefore not prominent in our
accounts of Greek property. The cock is spoken of as a Persian
bird, the pheasant as a Colchian, and peacocks were an
object of curiosity at Athens in Pericles’ day. The culture of
bees, on the other hand, was of great importance, as it took
the place of the sugar plantations of our day—all sweetmeats
being flavored with honey.</p>

<p>It seems certain that the greatest part of the wealth of the
Greeks consisted in these out-of-door possessions, which were
managed by slave stewards and shepherds for their masters,
if they lived in the city. There is reason to think that they
neither laid up much money in banks, nor kept any great treasures
in the way of changes of raiment, like the Orientals, nor
in furniture and works of art, like the Romans and moderns.
But owing to the many wars and invasions, this agricultural
wealth was precarious, and liable to sudden destruction.
House property, again, which in walled towns was pretty safe,
is from its own nature perishable. Private wealth therefore
was not great on the average, and the splendid monuments of
Greek art in its best days were all the result of public spirit,
and not of private enterprise or bounty. A fortune of $250,000
in all kinds of property is the extreme limit we know of,
and is spoken of much as $250,000,000 would be now-a-days.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>The early inhabitants of Greece, and of the islands in the
beautiful Ægean, were an active race, sprightly, and highly
imaginative. Though, as yet, uncultured and unaided, their
vivid conceptions of things natural and supernatural, visible
and invisible, found expression in <i>legends</i> that embodied their
often crude ideas. After some progress in civilization, and
the introduction of letters, these were perfected and embellished
by men of poetic genius, to whom we are indebted for many a
charming story. Are these stories true? Perhaps not, yet
they are true types of the intelligence and thought of the men
of that age and country.</p>

<p>Much is unreal. But, if to us with the diviner light, after
centuries of progress, and habits of thought so different, some
things appear childish, and others inexplicable if not absurdly
false, we will not hastily condemn what we fail to understand.
Modern writers have done much to remove from our common
heritage of mythical tradition what seemed repulsive in it;
while they preserve for us the exquisite poetry that breathes
especially in Homeric lines, and will survive the most destructive
criticism.</p>

<h4>COSMOGONY.</h4>

<p>The facts and problems of the visible universe have engaged
the attention of thoughtful men in all ages. The outer sensuous
world exists. Whence came it, and how? The early
Greeks had, it seems, no idea of creation, or of an intelligent creator,
yet felt bound to account to themselves for what they saw.</p>

<p>According to the most common account, the world, with all
its solid, tangible things, was formed from chaos—and by
chaos was meant, so far as appears, not a shapeless confused
mass of things in any way objective to the senses, but merely
space, a dark illimitable void wherein dwelt utter nothingness.
As to how the world proceeded thence, there was little agreement.
The most popular view is that, in some unaccountable
manner, Gea (the earth) issued from the vast womb of chaos.
The process once begun the development was surprisingly
rapid. Tartarus, the abyss below, immediately severed itself.
Eros (the love that forms and binds all things) sprung into
existence. Gea then begot, of herself, Uranus (heaven), the
mountains, and Pontus (the sea).</p>

<p>Their notions of the structure of the universe are a slight
advance on their ideas of its origin. These give their coloring
to many of their narratives.</p>

<p>“The Greek poets believed the earth to be flat and circular—their
own country occupying the middle of it, the central
point being either Mount Olympus, the abode of the gods, or
Delphi, so famous for its oracle.” Those in the more remote
parts, and having never seen the sacred mountain, supposed
its summit quite in the heavens, and occupied by superior
beings. Those who were nearer knew better, but fancied
the gods, or immortals, often came down and frequented its
grand solitudes, holding their councils, or having their pleasures
apart from men.</p>

<p>The circular disc of the earth was crossed from east to west
and divided into two equal parts by the “sea,” as they called
the Mediterranean, and its continuation, the Euxine.</p>

<p>Around the earth flowed the “River Ocean,” its course being
from south to north on the western, and in a contrary direction
on the eastern side. It flowed in a steady, equable current, as
was supposed, unvexed by storm or tempest. The sea and all
the rivers on earth received their waters from it.</p>

<p>The northern portion of the earth they supposed inhabited
by a happy race named Hyperboreans, dwelling in blissful
bowers, and perpetual spring beyond the lofty mountains
whose caverns were believed to send forth the piercing blasts
of the north-wind, which chilled the people of Hellas (Greece).
Their country was inaccessible by land or sea. They lived
exempt from disease or old age, from toils and warfare. Moore
has given us the “Song of a Hyperborean,” beginning—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I come from a land in the sun bright deep,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Where golden gardens glow,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Where the winds of the north, becalmed in sleep,</div>
<div class="verse i3">Their conch-shells never blow.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the south side of the earth, close to that fancied stream,
or “River Ocean,” dwelt a people happy and virtuous as the
Hyperboreans. They were named Æthiopians. The gods
favored them highly, and at times left their Olympian abodes,
going down to share their sacrifices and banquets.</p>

<p>On the western margin of the earth, fast by the “River
Ocean,” spread out a beautiful plain named Elysiam, whither
mortals, favored by the gods, were transported without tasting
death, to enjoy an immortality of bliss. This happy region
was also called by them “Fortunate Fields,” and “Isles of
the Blessed.”</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind by the young reader of their fables,
or legends, that the Greeks of the mythological period were
an isolated people, knowing but little of geography, and
nothing of any real people except those to the east and south
of their own country, or near the coast of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>The western portion of this sea, of unknown extent, their
imagination peopled with giants and enchantresses, while
around them, at unknown distances, and perhaps but remotely
connected with their own earthly habitation, they
placed communities enjoying the peculiar favor of the gods,
having serene happiness and longevity—human, but akin to
the immortals.</p>

<p>Of the heavens above them still less was yet known, though
they studied astronomy, and noted how some bodies moved,
while others were apparently stationary.</p>

<p>Probably they had some vague notion of life and volition in
things that move, and when the sun and moon were said to
rise from the ocean and drive through the air, giving light to
gods and men, the language was, to them, scarcely metaphorical.</p>

<p>Knowing nothing of the revolution of the earth, the succession
of days and nights was accounted for by supposing the
sun-god to descend into the “River Ocean,” and embark in
his winged boat, which carried him swiftly around the northern
part of the earth, back to his place of rising in the east.</p>

<p>Milton, in his “Comus,” thus translates their philosophy on
the subject:</p>

<h4>THE GODS OF OLYMPUS.</h4>

<p>Zeus (Jupiter) was the supreme god of both Greek and Roman
mythology. In our English literature on the subject the
Latin names occur more frequently, are more familiar, and are
used without further explanation.</p>

<p>Before Homer wrote the “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” Jupiter had
come to be regarded by the Greeks as the father of all gods and
men, but he had not always that distinction. The earlier myths
gave his descent, and according to some legends there was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
time when Cronos, father of Jupiter, was supreme; but even
he was not first in the order of the gods. The imaginary line
of their descent stretched far back till lost in deepest mystery,
but it led not to the Everlasting Self-existent One. According
to Hesiod their highest gods were really earth born. The first
beings were Chaos and Gea. The latter gave birth to Uranus—whence
sprang a race of twelve Titans, six males—Oceanus,
Cœus, Crius, Hyperion, Japetus, and Cronus; six females—Thia,
Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phœbe, and Thetis.</p>

<p>The interpretation of these divinities is difficult, but they
doubtless represented some real or supposed elementary forces
of nature.</p>

<p>The different stories respecting things, not known but imagined,
were often at variance, nor need we attempt to harmonize
them, as each district or city had its own version.
From other sources it would be possible to construct a different
genealogy, but that here given was somewhat generally
accepted.</p>

<p>Ouranos, or Uranus, is the heaven which is spread like a
vail over the earth, and was much the same to the Greeks as
the old Hindu god Varuna, whose name has a verbal root
meaning to vail or conceal.</p>

<p>Having attributed some kind of intelligence and personality
to the vast expanse stretching itself overhead, they represent
this sovereign, Ouranos, as hurling the Cyclops with Bronte,
Sterope (thunder and lightning), and other children of Gea,
into the abyss called Tartarus; and that Gea, in her grief and
anger, urged her other children to insurrection against their
father, and to set Cronos instead on his throne.</p>

<p>When Cronos (time) became king he is represented as so
voracious and cruel that all his children were devoured soon
after each was born. The basis of this legendary fact is evident,
as time swallows up the days and weeks, months and
years, as they come each in its order, and thus “bears all its
sons away.”</p>

<p>These acts of Cronos, the reputed cannibal among such as
interpret the fable literally, connect with the history of Jupiter.
Rhea, his wife, and the mother of Jupiter, anxious to save her
child, having already lost five, determined to save her next
son from a cruel fate by stratagem. A stone was given to the
husband, wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed
without examination or suspicion, and the little Jupiter, thus
rescued, was reared by the nymphs in a cave on Mount Diete,
or Ida, in Crete. He was nourished on goat’s milk, and the
bees brought him honey to eat. That the cries of the child
might not betray his presence, and the mother’s strategy, the
Curetes, or attendant priests of Rhea, drowned his voice by
the clashing of their weapons.</p>

<p>Jupiter thus remained hidden till he speedily became a young,
but very powerful god. He then attacked and overthrew his
father Cronos, whom he also compelled by a device of Gea, to
bring forth the children he had already devoured. Some of
the Titans, as Oceanus, Themis, Mnemosyne, and Hyperion,
at once submitted to the dominion of the new ruler of the
world. The others refused allegiance. But after a contest of
years Jupiter, with the help of the Cyclops and Centimani,
overthrew them. As a punishment they were cast into Tartarus,
which was then closed by Poseidon with brazen gates.</p>

<p>Thessaly, which bears evident traces of having suffered
much from natural convulsions, was supposed to have been
the scene of this mighty war.</p>

<p>Jupiter and his adherents fought from Olympus, the Titans
from the opposite mountain of Othrys. Thenceforward the
victor shared the empire of the world with his two brothers,
Poseidon and Hades. The former he made ruler of the ocean
and waters, the latter he set over the infernal regions. This
new order of things, however, was by no means at once securely
established. The resentment of Gea led her to produce a
younger and most powerful son, the great Typhœus, a monster
with a hundred fire-breathing heads, whom she sent to attack
the thunder-bearer. A great battle took place which shook
heaven and earth, but Jupiter, by means of his crushing thunderbolts,
at length overcame his antagonist, and cast him into
Tartarus, or, according to others, buried him beneath Mount
Ætna, in Sicily, whence at times he still breathes out fire and
flames toward heaven.</p>

<p>“Some tell of another rebellion of the giants against the
dominion of Jupiter. From the plains of Phlegra they sought
to scale and storm Olympus, by piling, through their great
strength, Pelion on Ossa; but after a bloody battle they too
were overpowered, and shared the fate of the Titans. After
that no hostile attack ever disturbed the peaceful ease of the
inhabitants of Olympus.”</p>

<p>The character of the acknowledged chief of their deities,
who is supposed against all opposition to control and rule the
universe, is not drawn, in the earlier myths, as one of untarnished
excellence. Yet the good predominates, and he is
confessed a beneficent ruler. He was, in time, reverenced as
Jupiter-pater, the source of all life in nature, and the almoner
of abundant blessings for his obedient subjects and children.
All the phenomena of the air were supposed to proceed from
him. “He gathers and disperses the clouds, casts forth the
lightnings, stirs up his thunder, sends down rain, hail, snow,
and fertilizing dew upon the earth. With his ægis he produces
storm and tempest, and at his pleasure stills the warring
elements.”</p>

<p>“The ancients, however, were not content to regard Jupiter
as merely a personification of nature. They regarded him also
from an ethical stand-point, from which side he appears far
more important and awful. They saw in him a personification,
so to speak, of that principle of undeviating order and harmony,
which pervades both the physical and moral world.
The strict, unalterable laws, by which he rules the community
of the gods, form a strong contrast with the capricious commands
of his father Cronos.”</p>

<p>Hence Jupiter is regarded as the protector and defender of
political order. From him the kings of the earth receive their
sovereignty and their rights; to him they are responsible for a
conscientious fulfillment of their duties. Those of them who
pervert justice he never fails to punish. He also presides over
their assemblies, keeps watch over their orderly course, and
suggests to them wise counsels.</p>

<p>One of the most important props of political society is the
oath; and accordingly he watches over oaths, and punishes
perjury.</p>

<p>He also watches over boundaries, and accompanies the
youths of the land as they go out to defend the borders of
their country, and gives them victory over the invaders. All
civil and political communities enjoy his protection; but he
watches particularly over that association which is the basis of
the political fabric—the family.</p>

<p>The head of every household was, therefore, in a certain
sense, the priest of Jupiter, and presented his offerings in the
name of the family. As Jupiter <i>hospitalis</i>, he protects the
wanderer, and punishes those who violate the ancient laws of
hospitality by mercilessly turning the helpless stranger from
their door.</p>

<p>The superstition of early times saw in all physical phenomena
manifestations of the divine will, and this, their earliest and
chief deity, was naturally regarded as the source of inspiration,
revealing his will to men in the thunder, lightning, flight
of birds, and dreams. He not only had his oracle at Dodona,
which was the most ancient in Greece, but also revealed the
future by the mouth of his favorite son, Apollo. In hours of real
trouble and grief, Achilles and other Achaians prayed to Jupiter,
not only as irresistible in might, but also as just and righteous.</p>

<p>Yet others, and possibly the same persons under other circumstances,
and in different moods, represented him as partial,
unjust, fond of pleasure, changeable in his affections, and
unfaithful in his love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Greater inconsistencies and contradictions in character can
scarcely be conceived of. How such confused and contradictory
notions could occupy the same mind, may seem inexplicable.
The Greek name of their deity, a corporeal being,
was used by men having many excellent qualities, to express
all they thought of, or felt, toward God, the greatest and best,
worthy to be trusted and worshiped, but anthropomorphic
still, having human instincts and passions, in the essential
elements of his exalted nature, “altogether like unto themselves.”
Their ethical conceptions were marred by unconsciously
projecting their common humanity into the field of
view in which their god was contemplated.</p>

<p>But the name that became sacred also meant the physical
heaven, the sky with its clouds and vapor, and all embracing
atmosphere; and as the earth by a beautiful metaphor was
spoken of as the bride of the sky, which was said to overshadow
the earth with his love, in every land causing the birth
of all things that live and grow, so this idea of production—its
primary application forgotten by a people gross and sensual—transferred
to a deity of human form and passions, grew
up into strange stories of license, or unlawful love. It is by
no means certain that the poets and moralists, or ethical
writers accepted the grosser myths as true or expressive of
their own conceptions. The probability is against it. For,
while Hesiod, following the popular theology describes the descent
of the gods, their earthly loves, intrigues and gross immoralities,
yet he, at times, turns sharply away from all such
things as loathsome, to “thoughts of that pure and holy Zeus
(Jupiter), who looks down from heaven to see if men will do
justice, love mercy, and seek after God.”</p>

<p>Some regard the conceded goodness of the supreme beings
as sufficient reason for misbelieving all the stories that were to
their discredit; or if the stories were credited they would disprove
their supposed divinity.</p>

<p>Euripides said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If the gods do aught unseemly, then they are not gods at all.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">The great poets did not invent the myths, but found them
the only embodiment of the crude theology that was current
among the masses, perfected them by eliminating some of the
grosser parts, and sought to use them in the cause of virtue
and civilization.</p>

<p>Even those seeming most irrational, when traced to their
primary source and analyzed, were found to have something
of truth, and the glimmer of their light was welcomed where
without it the darkness had been yet more profound.</p>

<p>Dr. Ziller in his lecture on the development of Monotheism
in Greece says: “The great Greek poets were her first thinkers,
her sages, as they were afterward called. They sang of
Zeus (Jupiter), and exalted him as the defender of righteousness,
the representation of moral order.</p>

<p>“Archilocus says that ‘Zeus weighs and measures all the actions
of good and evil men, as well as those of animals.’ ‘He
is,’ said Terpandros somewhat later, ‘the source and ruler of
all things.’ According to Simonides, ‘the principle of all
created things rests with him, and he rules the universe by his
will.’”</p>

<p>Thus, as time went on, ideas of the divinity were elevated,
and Zeus, whose parentage and birth are chronicled as after
the manner of men, became, in the general conception, the
personification of the world’s government, which was delivered
from the fatality of destiny, and from the promptings of caprice.</p>

<p>Destiny, which according to the early mythical representation,
it was impossible to escape, is resolved into the will of
Zeus, and the other gods, which were at first supposed to be
able to oppose him, became his faithful ministers. Such is the
teaching of Solon and Epicharmos.</p>

<p>“Be assured that nothing escapes the eyes of the divinities.
God watches over us, and to him nothing is impossible.”
This impulse of the imaginative faculty combined with the
process of reason is most plainly seen in the conceptions of the
three great poets of the fifth century, Pindar, Æschylus, and
Sophocles. In the words of Pindar: “All things depend on
God alone; all which befalls mortals, whether it be good or
evil fortune, is due to Zeus; he can draw light from darkness,
and can vail the sweet light of day in obscurity. No human
action escapes him; happiness is found only in the way which
leads to him; virtue and wisdom flow from him alone.”</p>

<p>We need not multiply quotations to show that as the Greeks
advanced in civilization the earlier barbaric notions were left
for those more elevating, and though mostly polytheists till
visited by Christian teachers, their theology, or what was believed
respecting the divine beings, was more worthy of them
and had in general an elevating influence on their character.
Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hermes, Athene, Poseidon, Hera,
Hephaistus, Hestia, Demeter, Aphrodite and Jupiter himself
formed the body which in the days of Thucydides was worshiped,
and called “the twelve gods of Olympus.”</p>

<p>This ordering or classification is not recognized in the poems
of Homer. Hesiod more particularly describes the manner of
their birth and the attributes of the Olympic gods, and hence
that poem is called a Theogony.</p>

<p>Having mentioned the chief, the others may be briefly
noticed in their order. Phœbus Apollo was called Phœbus, as
being the god of light; in Homeric phrase the “Far glancing
Apollo”—the last name meaning, some say, destroyer, because
his rays, when powerful, can destroy the life of animals
and plants. At first the name meant the sun, but in later
times he was regarded as the god of light who was not confined
to his habitation in the sun. “He is called the son of
Zeus, because the sun, like Athene, or the dawn, springs in the
morning from the sky—and son of Leto because the night, as
going before his rising, may be considered as mother of the sun.”</p>

<p>One legendary story of his birth runs as follows: Leto, distressed,
wandered through many lands seeking in vain for a
resting place. At last she came to Delos (the bright land),
and said if she could there find shelter it should become glorious
as the birthplace of Phœbus, and that men should come
from all parts to enrich his temple with their gifts. Here,
then, Phœbus was born; heaven was propitious and the floating
Delos, a hard and stony land, was anchored and covered
itself with verdure and golden flowers. The nymphs clothed
him with a spotless robe, and when Themis fed him with
nectar and ambrosia, the food of gods, hating all things impure,
he was at once prepared to battle with and drive away
the evil powers of darkness.</p>

<p>With his bright arrows he slew the giant Tityus, and the
Python, a monster near Delphi, that destroyed both men and
cattle.</p>

<p>These and similar myths respecting his matchless conquering
power forcibly declare the influence of the sun’s rays in
scattering the night and dark gloom of winter. But though
Phœbus Apollo thus appears as the foe of all that is evil or
impure, other myths represent him as a terrible god of death,
sending pestilences and dealing out destruction to men and
animals by means of the arrows he scatters abroad.</p>

<p>Remembering the natural significance of the name this is
perfectly consistent with the genial influence attributed to him.
The sun’s rays do indeed put to flight the darkness of night
and the cold of winter, but their intense heat also causes disease
and death.</p>

<p>This is beautifully portrayed in the fable of the death of
Hyacinthus that will be given in the next number. His reputation
as a god of health, all powerful to protect against
physical maladies is not damaged, though, in exceptional
cases, his rays smite and destroy. But the healing that he
brings is not alone for the outward “ills that flesh is heir to.”
Diseases of the mind he cures or mitigates. Sin and crime
flee from the light, and troubled souls, that escape from guilt,
find consolation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Even those pursued by the Furies he sometimes receives
with tenderness and pity—a fine instance of which is found in
the oft told story of Orestes.</p>

<p>Much of his healing power connects with his character as
god of music, and from the fact of its soothing, tranquilizing
influence on the soul of man.</p>

<p>His favorite instrument was the lyre, on which he played
with masterly skill at the banquets of the gods, while the
Muses accompanied him with their wondrous strains. He
was regarded as the leader of the Muses and all the great
singers of antiquity, as Orpheus and Linus, are mythically represented
as his sons.</p>

<p>Of his prophetic character, statues, temples, and worship we
will speak hereafter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.—THE CAUSES OF INTEMPERANCE.</h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The Discovery of the Cause is the Discovery of the Remedy.—<span class="smcap">Bichat.</span></p>

</div>

<p>The undoubted antiquity of the poison vice has induced
several able physiologists to assume the hygienic necessity of
artificial stimulation. But the not less undoubted fact that
there have been manful, industrious and intelligent nations of
total abstainers would be an almost sufficient refutation of
that inference, which is sometimes qualified by the assertion
that the tonic value of alcoholic drinks is based upon the abnormal
demands upon the vitality of races exposed to the vicissitudes
of a rigorous climate and the manifold overstraining
influences of an artificial civilization. For it can, besides, be
proved that the alleged invigorating action of alcoholic drinks
is an absolute delusion, and the pathological records of contemporary
nations establish the fact that endemic increase of intemperate
habits can nearly always be traced to causes that have
no correlation whatever to the increased demands upon the physical
or intellectual energies of the afflicted community. Potentially
those energies have lamentably decreased among numerous
races who once managed to combine nature-abiding habits
with a plethora of vital vigor.</p>

<p>The physiologically unavoidable <i>progressiveness of all stimulant
habits</i> is a further argument in favor of the theory that
the poison vice has grown up from very small beginnings, and
the genesis of the fatal germ has probably been supplied in
the hypothesis of Fabio Colonna, an Italian naturalist of the
seventeenth century. “Before people used wine,” says he,
“they drank sweet must and preserved it, like oil, in jars or
skins. But in a warm climate a saccharine fluid is apt to ferment,
and some avaricious housekeeper may have drunk that
<i>spoiled</i> stuff till she became fond of it and learned to prefer it to
must.”</p>

<p>Avarice, aided perhaps by dietetic prurience, or indifference
to the warnings of instinct, planted the baneful seed, and the
laws of evolution did the rest.</p>

<p>But the tendency of those laws has often been checked, and
as certainly often been accelerated, by less uncontrollable
agencies.</p>

<p>The first venders of toxic stimulants (like our quack medicine
philanthropists) had a personal interest in disseminating
the poison habit. Reform attempts were met by appeals to
the convivial interests of the stimulant-dupe, by the seduction
of minors, by charges of asceticism; later by nostrum puffs
and opium wars. More than two thousand years ago the worship
of Bacchus was propagated by force of arms. The disciples
of Ibn Hanbal, the Arabian Father Mathew, were stoned
in the streets of Bagdad. The persecutions and repeated expulsions
of the Grecian Pythagoreans had probably a good deal
to do with the temperance teachings of their master. In Palestine,
in India, in mediæval Europe, nearly every apostle of
Nature had to contend with a rancorous opposition, inspired
by the most sordid motives of <i>self-interest</i>, and our own age
can in that respect not boast of much improvement. In spite
of our higher standard of philanthropic principles and their
numerous victories in other directions, the heartless alliance of
Bacchus and Mammon still stands defiant. In our own country
a full hundred thousand men, not half of them entitled to
plead the excuses of poverty or ignorance, unblushingly invoke
the protection of the laws in behalf of an industry involving
the systematic propagation of disease, misery and
crime. Wherever the interests of the poison traffic are at stake
the nations of Europe have not made much progress since the
time when the sumptuary laws of Lorenzo de Medici were defeated
by street riots and a shrieking procession of the Florentine
tavern-keepers.</p>

<p>The efforts of such agitators are seconded by the <i>Instinct of
Imitation</i>. “In large cities,” says Dr. Schrodt, “one may see
<i>gamins</i> under ten years grubbing in rubbish heaps for cigar
stumps; soon after leaning against a board fence, groaning
and shuddering as they pay the repeated penalty of nature,
yet, all the same, repeating the experiment with the resignation
of a martyr. The rich, the fashionable, do it; those whom
they envy smoke; smoking, they conclude, must be something
enviable.”</p>

<p>Without any intentional arts of persuasion the Chinese business
men of San Francisco have disseminated a new poison
vice by smoking poppy gum in the presence of their Caucasian
employes and accustoming them to associate the sight of an
opium debauch with the idea of enjoyment and recreation.
Would the opponents of prohibition attempt to deny that analogous
influences (the custom of “treating” friends at a public
bar, the spectacle of lager beer orgies in public gardens, etc.)
have a great deal to do with the initiation of boy topers?</p>

<p>Ignorance does not lead our dumb fellow-creatures to vicious
habits, and <i>prejudice</i> is therefore, perhaps, the more correct
name for the sad infatuation which tempts so many millions of
our young men to defy the protests of instinct and make themselves
the slaves of a life-destroying poison. Ignorance is
nescience. Prejudice is <i>mal-science</i>, <i>mis-creance</i>, trust in erroneous
teachings. Millions of children are brought up in the
belief that health can be secured only by abnormal means. A
pampered child complains of headache, want of appetite. Instead
of curing the evil by the removal of the cause, in the
way so plainly indicated by the monitions of instinct, the
mother sends to the drug-store. The child must “take something.”
Help must come through anti-natural means. A
young rake, getting more fretful and dyspeptic from day to day,
is advised to “try something,” an aloe pill, a bottle of medicated
brandy, any quack “specific,” recommended by its bitterness
or nauseousness. The protests of nature are calmly disregarded
in such cases; a dose of medicine, according to the
popular impression, can not be very effective unless it is very
repulsive. Our children thus learn to mistrust the voice of
their natural instincts. They try to rely on the aid of specious
arts, instead of trusting their troubles in the hands of nature.
Boys whose petty ailments have been palliated with stimulants
will afterward be tempted to drown their sorrow in draughts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the same nepenthe, instead of biding their time, like Henry
Thoreau, who preferred to “face any fate, rather than seek refuge
in the mist of intoxication.” Before the friends of temperance
can hope for a radical reform they must help to eradicate
the deep-rooted delusion of the stimulant fallacy; the
popular error which hopes to defy the laws of nature by the
magic of intoxicating drugs and thus secure an access of happiness
not attainable by normal means. Our text-books, our
public schools, should teach the rising generation to realize the
fact that the temporary advantage gained by such means is not
only in every case out-weighed by the distress of a speedy reaction,
but that the capacity for enjoyment itself is impaired
by its repeated abuse, till only the most powerful stimulants
can restore a share of that cheerfulness which the spontaneous
action of the vital energies bestows on the children of nature.</p>

<p>We have seen that the milder stimulants often form the stepping-stones
to a passion for stronger poisons. A penchant for
any kind of tonic drugs, nicotine, narcotic infusions, hasheesh,
the milder opiates, etc., may thus initiate a stimulant habit with
an unlimited capacity of development, and there is no doubt
that international traffic has relaxed the vigilance which helped
our forefathers to guard their households against the introduction
of foreign poison vices. Hence the curious fact that
drunkenness is not prevalent—not in the most ignorant or despotic
countries (Russia, Austria, and Turkey), nor in southern
Italy and Spain, where alcoholic drinks of the most seductive
kind are cheapest—but in the <i>most commercial countries</i>, western
France, Great Britain, and North America. Hence also
the fallacy of the brewer’s argument that the use of lager beer
would prevent the dissemination of the opium habit. No stimulant
vice has ever prevented the introduction of worse poisons.
Among the indirect causes of intemperance we must
therefore include our mistaken <i>toleration of the minor stimulant
habits</i>. The poison vice has become a many-headed hydra,
defying one-sided attacks, and it is no paradox to say that we could
simplify our work of expurgation by making it more thorough.</p>

<p><i>Polydipsia</i> is a derangement of the digestive organs characterized
by a chronic thirst, which forces its victims to swallow
enormous quantities of stimulating fluids. The biographer of
Richard Porson, the great classic scholar, says that his poison
thirst was “so outrageous that he can not be considered a
mere willful drunkard; one must believe that he was driven
into his excesses by some unknown disease of his constitution.”
… “He would pour anything down his throat
rather than endure the terrible torture of thirst. Ink, spirits
of wine for the lamp, an embrocation, are among the horrible
things he is reported to have swallowed in his extremity.” Polydipsia
is not always due to the direct or indirect (hereditary)
influence of the alcohol habit, and the origin of the disorder
was long considered doubtful; but it has since been traced to
a morbid condition of the kidneys, induced by the use of narcotic
stimulants (tea, coffee, tobacco), but often also by gluttony.</p>

<p>Like certain poison plants, the stimulant habit flourishes
best in a sickly soil. <i>Whatever tends to undermine the stamina
of the physical or moral constitution</i> helps to prepare the way
for an inroad of intemperance, by weakening the resistance of
the protective instincts. Hence the notorious fact that gambling
dens and houses of ill-fame are rank hot-beds of the
alcohol vice.</p>

<p><i>Asceticism</i> has not yet ceased to be an indirect obstacle to
the success of temperance reform. The children of nature
need no special holidays; to them life itself is a festival of
manifold sports. Hunting, fishing, and other pursuits of primitive
nations become the pastimes of later ages. For the abnormal
conditions of civilized life imply the necessity of providing
special means of recreation, out-door sports, competitive
gymnastics, etc., in order to satisfy the craving of an importunate
instinct; and too many social reformers have as yet
failed to recognize the truth that <i>the suppression of that
instinct avenges itself by its perversion</i>; by driving pleasure-seekers
from the play-ground to the pot-house, as despotism
has turned freemen into bandits and outlaws. “Every one
who considers the world as it really exists,” says Lecky, “must
have convinced himself that, in great towns, where multitudes
of men of all classes and all characters are massed together,
and where there are innumerable strangers, separated from all
domestic ties and occupations, public amusements of an exciting
order are absolutely necessary, and that to suppress
them is simply to plunge an immense portion of the population
into the lowest depths of vice.”</p>

<p>“I am a great friend to public amusements,” says Boswell’s
Johnson, “for they keep people from vice.” A home missionary
in the character of a promoter of harmless recreations
would double the popularity of our tenets, and by vindicating
our people against the charge of joy-hating bigotry deprive our
opponents of their most effective weapon. The free reading-rooms
and gymnasium of the New York Y. M. C. A. have done
more to promote the cause of temperance than the man hunts
of Sir Hudibras and all his disciples. We must change our
tactics. While our anchorite allies have contrived to make
virtue repulsive, our opponents have proved themselves consummate
masters of the art of masking the ugliness of vice;
they have strewn their path with roses and left us the thorns.
Yet I hope to show that we can beat them upon their own ground,
for it is not difficult to make health more attractive than disease.</p>

<p>But the most obstinate obstacle to a successful propagation
of total abstinence principles is the <i>drug fallacy</i>, a delusion
founded on precisely the same error which leads the dram-drinker
to mistake a process of irritation for a process of invigoration.
During the infancy of the healing art all medical theories
were biased by the idea that sickness is an enemy whose
attacks must be repulsed <i>à main forte</i>, by suppressing the symptoms
with fire, sword and poison—not in the figurative but in the
literal sense, the keystone dogma of the primitive Sangrados
having been the following heroic maxim: “What drugs won’t
cure must be cured with iron” (the lancet), “if that fails resort
to fire.” (<i>Quod medicamenta non curant ferrum curat, quod
non curat ferram ignis curat.</i>) But with the progress of the
physiological sciences the conviction gradually gained ground
that disease itself is a reconstructive process, and that the suppression
of the symptoms retards the accomplishment of that reconstruction.
And ever since that truth dawned upon the human
mind the use of poison drugs has steadily decreased. A
larger and larger number of intelligent physicians had begun to
suspect that the true healing art consists in the removal of the
cause, and that where diseases have been caused by unnatural
habits, the reform of those habits is a better plan than the old
counter-poison method; when homœopathy proved practically
(though not theoretically) that medication can be entirely dispensed
with. The true effect of the more virulent drugs
(opium, tartar emetic, arsenic, etc.) was then studied from a
physiological stand-point, and experiments proved what the
medical philosopher Asclepiades, conjectured eighteen hundred
years ago, namely, that if a drugged patient recovers, the true
explanation is that his constitution was strong enough to overcome
both the disease and the drug. Bichat, Schrodt, Magendie,
Alcott, R. T. Trall, Isaac Jennings and Dio Lewis arrived
at the conclusion that every disease is a protest of Nature
against some violation of her laws, and that the suppression of
the symptoms means to silence that protest instead of removing
its cause, so that we might as well try to extinguish a
fire by silencing the fire-bells, or to cure the sleepiness of a
weary child by pinching its eyelids—in short, that drastic drugs,
instead of “breaking up” a disease, merely interrupt it and
lessen the chance of a radical cure.</p>

<p>Are there reasons to suppose that alcohol or any other poison,
makes an exception from that general rule? We must reject
the idea <i>in toto</i>, and I hope to show that it is refuted:</p>

<p>1. By the testimony of our instincts.</p>

<p>2. By experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>3. By the direct or indirect concessions of the ablest physiologists.</p>

<p>Our instincts protest against medication. Against ninety-nine
of a hundred “remedial drugs” our sense of taste warns
us as urgently as against rotten eggs, verdigris, or oil of vitriol.
Shall we believe that nature repudiates the means of salvation?
Or that our protective instincts forsake us in the hour of our
sorest need—in the hour of our struggle with a life-endangering
disease? And the same instincts that protest against other
poisons warn us against all kinds of alcoholic drugs. Is it an
exception to that rule that the depraved taste of a drunkard
may relish a glass of medicated wine or a bottle of “Hostetter’s
bitters” (rye brandy)? If it is certain beyond all limits
of doubt that the health of the stoutest man is no safeguard
against the bane of the wretched poison, shall we believe that
he can encounter it with impunity when his vital strength is exhausted
by disease?</p>

<p>Has the stimulus of alcoholic beverages any remedial or
prophylactic effect? How does alcohol counteract the contagion
of climatic fevers? In precisely the same way as those
fevers arrest, or rather suspend, the progress of other disorders.
The vital process can not compromise with two diseases at the
same time. A fit of gastric spasms interrupts a toothache. A
toothache relieves a sick headache. The severest cold in the
head temporarily yields to an attack of small-pox. <i>Temporarily</i>,
I say, for the apparent relief is only a postponement of
an interrupted process. During the progress of the alcohol
fever (the feverish activity of the organism in its effort to rid
itself of a life-endangering poison) Nature has to suspend her
operations against a less dangerous foe. But each repetition
of that factitious fever is followed by a reaction that suspends
the prophylactic effect of the stimulus, and sooner or later the
total exhaustion of the vital energies not only leaves the system
at the mercy of the original foe, but far less able to resist
his attacks. “There is but one appalling conclusion to be deduced
from hospital records, medical statistics and the vast
array of facts which bear upon the subject,” says Professor
Youmans, “it is that among no class of society are the ravages
of contagious diseases so wide-spread and deadly as among
those who are addicted to the use of alcoholic beverages.”</p>

<p>Is alcohol a digestive tonic? Can we cure an indigestion by
the most indigestible of all chemical product! If a starving
man drops by the roadside we may get him on his legs by
drenching him with a pailful of vitriol, but after rushing ahead
for a few hundred steps he will drop again, more helpless than
before, by just as much as the brutal stimulus has still further
exhausted his little remaining strength. Thus alcohol excites,
and eventually tenfold exhausts, the vigor of the digestive system.
We can not bully Nature. We can not silence her protests
by a fresh provocation. Fevers can be cured by refrigeration;
indigestions by fasting and exercise, and at any rate the
possible danger of a relapse is infinitely preferable to the sure
evils of the poison drug. A few repetitions of the stimulant
process may initiate the alcohol vice and sow the seeds of a
life-long crop of woe and misery. A single dose of alcoholic
tonics may revive the fatal passion of half-cured drunkards
and forfeit their hard-earned chance of recovery. That chance,
and life itself, often depend on the hope of guarding the system
against a relapse of the stimulant-fever, and I would as
soon snatch a plank from a drowning man as that last hope
from a drunkard.</p>

<p>Alcohol lingers in our hospitals as slavery lingers in South
America, as torture lingers in the courts of eastern Europe.
Quacks prescribe it because it is the cheapest stimulant; routine
doctors prescribe it because its stimulating effect is more
infallible than that of other poisons; empirists prescribe it at
the special request of their patients, or as a temporary prophylactic;
others because they find it in the ready-made formulas
of their dispensatories. There is another reason which I might
forbear mentioning, but I hold that a half truth is a half untruth,
and I will name that other reason. Ignorant patients demand
an immediate effect. They send for a doctor, and are to pay
his bill; they expect to get their money’s worth in the form of
a prompt and visible result. Instead of telling the im-patient
that he must commit himself into the hands of Nature, that
she will cure him in her own good time, by a process of her
own, and that all art can do for him is to give that process the
best possible chance, and prevent a willful interruption of it—instead
of saying anything of the kind, Sangrado concludes to
humor the popular prejudice and to produce the desired prompt
and visible effect. For that purpose alcohol is, indeed, the
most reliable agent. It will spur the jaded system into a desperate
effort to expel the intruder, though the strength expended
in that effort should be ever so urgently needed for better purposes.
The dose is administered; the patient can not doubt
that a “change” of some kind or other has been effected; the
habitual drunkard perhaps feels it to be a (momentary) change
for the better; at all events the doctor has done something and
proved that he can “control the disease.” In some exceptional
cases of that sort the influence of imagination may help to
cure a believing patient, or Nature may be strong enough to
overcome the disease and the stimulant at one effort. And if
a doctor can reconcile it with his conscience to risk such
experiments how shall we prevent it? As a first step in the
right direction we can refuse to swallow his prescription.
Physicians have no right to experiment on the health of their
patients. They have no right to expect that we shall stake our
lives on the dogmas of the old stimulant theory till they have
answered the objections of the Naturalistic School.</p>

<p>Drastic drugs are not wholly useless. There are two or three
forms of disease which have (thus far) not proved amenable to
any non-medicinal cure, and can hardly be trusted to the healing
power of Nature:—the <i>lues venera</i>, scabies and prurigo,
because, as a French physiologist suggests, “the cause and the
symptoms are here, for once, identical, the probable proximate
cause being the agency of microscopic parasites, which oppose
to the action of the vital forces a life-energy of their own.”
Antidotes and certain anodynes will perhaps also hold their
own till we find a way of producing their effects by mechanical
means.</p>

<p>But with these rare exceptions it is by far the safer as well as
shorter way to avoid drugs, reform our habits and not interrupt
the course of nature, for, properly speaking, “<i>disease
itself is a healing process</i>.” “It is not true,” says Dr. Jennings,
“that the human system, when disturbed and deranged in its
natural operations, becomes suicidal in its action …; such
a view presents an anomaly in the universe of God’s physical
government. It is not in accordance with the known operations
and manifestations of other natural laws” (“Medical
Reform,” p. 29). “The idea that the symptoms of disease
must be suppressed,” says Wichat, “has led to innumerable
fallacies and blunders.”</p>

<p>Dr. Benjamin Rush said in a public lecture: “I am here
incessantly led to make an apology for the instability of the
theories and practice of physic, and those physicians generally
become the most eminent, who have the soonest emancipated
themselves from the tyranny of the schools of physic. Dissections
daily convince us of our ignorance of disease and cause
us to blush at our prescriptions. What mischief have we
done under the belief of false facts and false theories! We
have assisted in multiplying diseases; we have done more, we
have increased their mortality. I will not pause to beg pardon
of the faculty, for acknowledging, in this public manner, the
weakness of our profession. I am pursuing Truth, and am indifferent
whither I am led, if she only is my leader.”</p>

<p>“Our system of therapeutics,” says Jules Virey, “is so shaky
(<i>vacillant</i>) that the soundness of the basis itself must be suspected.”</p>

<p>“The success of the homœopathic practice has astonished
many discerning minds,” says Dr. Jennings. “It is unnecessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
for my present purpose to give a particular account of the
results of homœopathy; … what I now claim with respect
to it is, that a wise and beneficent Providence is using it
to expose a deep delusion. In the result of homœopathic practice,
we have evidence in amount, and of a character sufficient,
most incontestably to establish the fact that disease is a restorative
process, a renovating operation, and that medicine has
deceived us. The evidence is full and complete. It does not
consist merely of a few isolated cases, whose recovery might
be attributed to fortuitous circumstances, but it is a chain of
testimony fortified by every possible circumstance. All kinds
and grades of disease have passed under the ordeal, and all
classes and characters of persons have been concerned in the
experiment as patients or witnesses; … <i>while the process
of infinitesimally attenuating the drugs was carried to such a
ridiculous extent that no one will, on sober reflection, attribute
any portion of the cure to the medicine</i>. I claim then, that homœopathy
may be regarded as a providential sealing of the fate
of old medical views and practices” (“Medical Reform,” p. 247).</p>

<p>Since physiology was first studied methodically an overwhelming
array of facts has, indeed, proved that the disorders
of the human organism can be cured more easily without poison
drugs; more easily in the very degree that would suggest the
suspicion that our entire system of therapeutics is founded
upon an erroneous view of disease. The homœopathists cure
their patients with milk-sugar, the exponents of the movement
cure with gymnastics, the hydropathists with cold water, the
disciples of Dr. Schrodt with exercise and mountain-air, the
primitive Christians with prayer, Nature cures her children
with rest and a partial suspension of the digestive process (the
fasting cure, indicated instinctively by a loss of appetite). Let
all repudiate alcohol and all can record swifter, more numerous,
and more permanent cures than the disciples of the nostrum
school.</p>

<p>Considered in connection with the foregoing remarks, these
facts admit only of one conclusion, and after giving the above-mentioned
exception the benefit of a (temporary) doubt, we can
assert with perfect confidence that drastic drugs have no remedial
value, and that every drop of alcohol administered for
medicinal purposes, has increased, instead of decreasing, the
weight of human misery.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but these views will awaken the anathemas
of the poison-worshipers; but it is equally certain that
before the end of this century they will become truisms. We
should regard the drift of the main current rather than the
incidental fluctuations of scientific theories, and all the ripple
of conflicting opinions can not conceal the progress of a strong
tendency toward total abstinence from all virulent drugs.</p>

<h3>II. WHEAT, RYE AND CORN.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BYRON D. HALSTED.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The three grains here treated, viz.: wheat, rye and corn,
belong to the vast order of plants known as the grass family
(<i>Gramineæ</i>). This large group of plants, the members of which
are so closely related as to be quickly recognized as such, contains
many of the most valuable of all cultivated plants. It
not only furnishes the cereals, namely: wheat, rye, corn, oats,
barley and rice, which supply the world with the larger part of
its starchy food, but clothes the pasture and meadow of the
farmer with the herbage so essential to the sustenance of his
live stock. There is a deep and weighty truth in the familiar
expression: “All flesh is grass.” Blot out the grass family
from existence and nearly all forms of life would suffer, and
many kinds would soon perish from the earth.</p>

<p>The grasses are usually low and comparatively small plants—though
the bamboos of the tropics are almost treelike, with
jointed stems and alternate, slender leaves. The flowers are
inconspicuous, usually in spikes or spreading clusters, with
three stamens, anthers versatile, styles two, stigma feathery,
ovary one-celled, becoming a grain.</p>

<p>Wheat has probably more intrinsic value than any other
plant grown. It is probably a native of southwestern Asia,
but like most grains and fruits cultivated from remote antiquity,
its early history is extremely uncertain. Many varieties have
been produced from the original <i>Triticum vulgare</i>—the scientific
name of wheat—but they can all be placed in the two following
groups: Those that are tender called spring wheats,
sown in spring, and the winter sorts that are sown in autumn,
remain on the ground through the winter and are harvested the
subsequent summer. The winter wheats are the more valuable
and bring a higher price than the spring varieties. Some
wheats have long awns to the flowers, and are termed bearded,
while other sorts are nearly or entirely awnless, and are sometimes
styled bald. There is a great variation in the size and
color of the grain. In some varieties it is long, others short;
some are white, others brown, red, and amber; some are hard,
others are soft. New sorts are produced yearly, and the
varieties have become practically innumerable.</p>

<p>The area devoted to the growth of wheat in the United
States is between thirty-five and forty million acres, and the
yield of the present season (1884) will not be far from 500,000,000
bushels. The average yield per acre, take the whole country
through, is not far from thirteen bushels per acre. Nineteen
states (and territories) cultivate over a million acres each; six
over two millions, and three over three millions, namely:
Illinois, 3,218,542; Iowa, 3,049,288; and Minnesota, 3,044,670
acres, as given in the last census. In the order of the number
of bushels produced, the leading states stand thus: Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota, Iowa, California. New
York stands thirteenth, and Rhode Island last, with seventeen
acres and 240 bushels. It will be seen that the wheat region,
strictly speaking, is in the Mississippi Valley, centering around
Illinois, with a secondary area in middle California. According
to the report on the cereal production of the United States by
Professor Wm. H. Brewer, in the statistics of agriculture in the
tenth census, the yield and quality of the wheat crops is
stated to depend upon five conditions: climate, soil, variety
cultivated, method of cultivation and the liability to destruction
by insects. The quality of the grain depends more upon the
climate than the soil. A hot, dry and sunny harvest produces a
grain of the highest quality. The ideal climate for wheat growing
is most nearly reached during the best years in California, and
it is then and there that we have records of the greatest yields
of the best of wheat.</p>

<p>A good rich soil is needed for successful wheat growing.
This may be preserved on any farm by a well regulated system
of crop rotation. It must be borne in mind that wheat has a
short season for its growth and needs to have food prepared
and close at hand. One of the best preparatory crops is clover.
The clover sod, including the vast amount of roots, furnishes a
most acceptable feeding ground for the wheat. The soil itself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
is not one of the items most frequently overlooked in wheat
growing. The importance of good plump seed of the best
varieties is rarely overestimated. There is a vast deal in the
sort of wheat grown, and no one can afford to grow any but
the best.</p>

<p>The most common diseases of wheat are rust and smut, both
of vegetable origin. These troubles, which appear so suddenly
and are often very destructive, are minute microscopic plants
of the order of fungi, and therefore related to the moulds and
mildews common on various articles of food, etc. The insect
enemies are somewhat numerous, but the Hessian fly, wheat
midge, joint worm, chinch bug, army worms, and Rocky
Mountain locust are the most destructive. There are a few
insects that prey upon the grain after it is in the granary, and
these are on the increase. Among the enemies we should not
forget to mention various weeds that spring up in the fields and
endeavor to choke out the legitimate occupants of the soil.</p>

<p>The nutritive value and chemical composition of wheat grain
are important points worthy of consideration here, because
this general article is to be followed by one upon the culinary
aspects of the grain treated. The market value of a flour largely
rests upon its appearance, while the nutritive value depends
upon the results determined by the analytical chemist. The
average of fifty-seven analyses of winter wheat in the kernel
gave:</p>

<p>It will be seen that there is very little chemical difference
between winter and spring wheats. The composition of the
flour shows a removal of nearly all the woody fiber, two thirds
of the ash, nearly half the fat and a small reduction of the
albuminoids, while the water is somewhat and the carb-hydrates
(starch, gum, etc.) considerably increased. It will be interesting
to here give an analysis of wheat bran and shorts:</p>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>By a comparison of these tables it will be easy to note the
positions in the kernel occupied by the various substances.
The fiber, ash, fat, and albuminoids are more abundant in the
outer portion of the grain, especially the first three. It must
be kept in mind that the albuminoids are the most expensive
elements of food, and are frequently called the “flesh formers,”
because they produce muscles. The starchy compounds
are employed for the production of heat in the animal system.
The functions and comparative importance of these several
constituents are already given at some length in the article on
the potato in a previous issue of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rye</span> (<i>Secale cereale</i>).—This grain was grown by the Egyptians
and other eastern nations, and its nativity is lost in oblivion.
It is of far less importance than wheat, and does not possess
any remarkable tendency to vary from its normal type. It has
a wider range of growth than wheat, and flourishes in cooler
regions than those adapted for most of the other grains. There
are both spring and winter varieties. The preparation of the soil,
the seeding, harvesting, etc., are much the same as for wheat.
It will succeed on a poorer soil and with less attention than
wheat. On this account rye was a more important crop in the
earlier centuries of the development of the human race than
to-day. Rye bread was a daily food among our people in the
colonial days, and in some old countries where the soil has
been too much worn out for wheat rye is grown successfully.
The opening up of various parts of our country by railroads
has checked the rye industry, and introduced wheat in its
place.</p>

<p>The acreage of rye in the United States in 1880 was 1,842,303
acres, yielding 19,831,595 bushels. The states producing over
a million bushels are only five, namely, Pennsylvania, Illinois,
New York, Wisconsin, and Iowa. The amount of rye grown
in the United States in 1839 was more than that at ten, twenty,
or thirty years later. Its cultivation for bread has rapidly decreased,
but for other purposes there is an apparent increase.
Rye makes an excellent green fodder crop, and is also employed
for plowing under as a green manure. The straw is the
primary crop in many sections, there being a good market for
this excellent product. The chemical composition of rye differs
somewhat from that of wheat, being poorer in albuminoids.
The wheat flours average 11.09 per cent. of albuminoids, while
that of rye is 6.65. Rye bran is, on the other hand, richer in
these constituents than wheat. Professor Brewer, to whom we
are indebted for many of our percentages here given, says:
“These figures are so plain that they scarcely require comment,
and they illustrate why fine wheat flour is so much
better than fine rye bread, and also why the difference in nutritious
qualities between coarse rye bread and fine rye bread is so
much greater than between coarse wheat bread and fine wheat
bread.” Rye is subject to fungoid attacks, one of which is of special
interest—the “spurred” rye, or ergot. The fungus causes
the grains to increase to several times their normal size, and become
purple, hard and curved, somewhat resembling the spurs
of a cock. This ergotted or “spurred” grain is very poisonous.
In some parts of Europe, where rye is largely grown,
there have been extensive epidemics among the people, caused
by eating rye affected with ergot. The insect enemies are
nearly the same as those mentioned with wheat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corn.</span>—Indian corn, or maize, is the leading grain crop of
the United States. The area devoted to this grain for the present
year is not far from seventy million acres, and the yield will
not fall much short of two thousand million bushels (2,000,000,000).
According to the census of 1880, the six following
states produced over a hundred million bushels each: Illinois,
over three hundred and twenty-five millions; Iowa, over two
hundred and seventy-five millions; Missouri, over two hundred
and two millions; Indiana, over one hundred and fifteen millions;
Ohio, over one hundred and eleven millions, and Kansas
over one hundred and five millions. Corn is very generally
distributed over the whole country, but it attains its greatest
excellence on the rich lands of the western prairies.</p>

<p>There is but little doubt that Indian corn is of American origin.
Columbus and other discoverers found it cultivated by the natives
of the New World. Since that time Indian corn has been
carried to all parts of the globe, and in many places it is grown
with profit. The corn plant is botanically <i>Zea mays</i>, and is
very unlike any of the other cereals in the arrangement of its
flowers. The clusters of male or pollen bearing flowers are at
the upper end of the stalk, forming the tassel, while the female
flowers are crowded upon a spike situated upon one side of
the stalk, midway between the top and the bottom. This separation
of the flowers permits of ready cross fertilization; that
is, the grains of one ear are very likely to be impregnated with
flower-dust showered down from the tassel of a neighboring
plant. The truth of this is always demonstrated when two distinct
varieties, as white and yellow sorts, are planted in adjoining
rows. There will be a “mixing” in nearly every ear
along the border line. This ease in crossing permits the farmer
to combine the good qualities of desirable sorts; in other words
corn may be bred and has been bred as successfully as any
kind of live stock. The corn plant also has a very plastic nature,
and quickly responds to any favoring conditions of soil, climate
or culture. We should therefore expect to find the number
of varieties of Indian corn without number. Many attempts
have been made to classify the different sorts. A common
grouping is into field, sweet, pop and husk sorts. Another
is into flint, Tuscarora, dent, and sweet varieties. Some of the
leading characteristics in the classification are color of grain,
rows on cob, size and form of grain, etc. The field varieties include
dents and flints, and are grown in large areas. The sweet
corns have a large per cent. of sugar, and are grown for eating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in the green condition. The pop corns are small sorts, with a
very hard covering. The stalks of corn vary from two to
twenty feet in length, and the ears from half an ounce to a
pound and a half. The number of rows of grain on the cob
is always even, and ranges from four to forty. The grain varies
in color; it may be white, yellow, violet, purple, blue, slate,
black, or variegated.</p>

<p>A good corn ground is rich, warm, deep and mellow. Unlike
the other cereals, the work of culture in the cornfield is
only well begun when the plants appear above the surface.
Being in rows there is a fine opportunity offered for weeds to
come in and occupy the soil before the corn plants make
enough growth to defend their rights to the land. The first
enemy to the corn is the cut-worm, and the next is the crow.
If it were not for the cut-worm it is probable that the crow
would rarely visit the corn-field. The crow is the enemy of
the cut-worm and many other injurious farm pests. He may
pull some corn for two weeks in the year, but during the other
fifty he is clearly on the farmer’s side. The weeds are the
worst enemies to the corn, and smut comes next. This trouble
is, like the wheat rust and the ergot of the rye, a member of
the fungus group. The smut appears on various parts of the
plant, but usually on the ear. All smutted parts should be cut
out and burned, as they are unfit for food, and this prevents
the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of corn is more variable than that
of wheat. The following table may be compared with that
given for wheat. An average of a large number of analyses
is given for each item:</p>

<p>The most striking difference between wheat and corn is the
amount of oil or fat. In wheat this ranges from 1.26 to 2.67
per cent., while in corn it averages 5.29, or from two to three
times as much. The popular opinion that corn is a heating
and fattening food is therefore supported by chemical analyses.
It will be seen from the table that the sweet corns contain much
more fat and a larger per cent. of albuminoids than the other
varieties. These, therefore, have a higher nutritive value.
Whatever may have been said in favor of or against either the
flint or dent varieties falls to the ground in the light of the average
analyses of these classes when brought side by side. It
will be seen that the differences are practically nothing. It is
only a matter of fancy which is employed. Much has been
said concerning color, but this is little more than skin deep,
and does not affect the quality of the food derived from the
grain. Those families which have become accustomed to yellow
corn prefer it, and those using the white sorts like these
best. It is a matter of taste, in one sense, and not of <i>taste</i> in
another.</p>

<p>Chemistry shows no great difference in the percentage of
albuminoids in wheat and corn, but it is a fact that all the differences
can not be set down in figures. The housewife knows
very well that a light, spongy bread is not easily made from
corn; in other words, corn bread is very different in texture
from wheat bread, even when the two flours are equally well
prepared. Much may be due to the greater amount of oil in
the corn, but there is little doubt that the gluten of corn is of a
different texture or character than that in wheat. This most
important constituent is subject to great variation in wheat, so
much so that this grain grown in one locality makes a light
bread, while that from another, in the same hands and under
the same treatment, yields a heavy bread, and of poor quality.
No one doubts that much improvement may be made in the
milling of corn—as much, perhaps, as has been recently effected
in that of wheat. We may look for a “new process” by
which our corn bread may be vastly improved.</p>

<p>Corn is, however, the great fattening food for swine and other
live stock, and we should be satisfied to take our corn in that
transmuted form when it appears upon our tables as a fragrant
spare-rib or a juicy and tender chop or beefsteak.</p>

<p>Of the three grains herein briefly treated we have seen that
wheat stands at the head as a food for man in our country. In
any form it is prepared it can be a complete and palatable
food. The albuminoids (gluten, etc.) are in such abundance
and form that the flour may produce snowy, spongy and most
healthful bread—truly a staff of life on which all rejoice to lean.
Rye is a declining grain, it being replaced by wheat. It will
grow on poorer soil than wheat, but with the many kinds of
commercial fertilizers at our service no one should grow rye because
of an impoverished soil. Corn in all its bearings is a
peer of wheat. It is in one sense our contribution to the
world’s list of grains, and in this we justly take pride. It is
more largely grown than any other crop, and as a source of
natural wealth it stands ahead of wheat. As a plant corn is
most interesting, being plastic and quickly responsive to any
favoring conditions. If corn is king, as some claim, wheat is
certainly queen in this royal family of cereals.</p>

<h3 id="BREAD">BREAD.</h3>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY MRS. EMMA P. EWING.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The first thing to be considered in bread making is the yeast.
Without good yeast it is impossible to make good bread. A
great deal depends upon the quality of flour used for making
bread; but unless the yeast is good the best quality of bread
can not be made from the most superior grade of flour, and
much excellent flour is spoiled by conjunction with worthless
yeast in the attempt to make it into bread.</p>

<p>The compressed yeast, so much used in cities, is, in all respects,
the best commercial yeast yet discovered, and when
fresh, is perfectly reliable, but can not be obtained conveniently
at all times, and in all places. And the housewife who
is ambitious to supply her family with good bread should acquaint
herself with the best method of making yeast, and have
it prepared at home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Make Yeast.</span>—Steep an eighth of an ounce of pressed,
or a small handful of loose hops in a quart of boiling water
for about five minutes. Strain the boiling infusion upon half
a pint of flour, stirred to a smooth paste with a little cold
water. Mix well, boil a minute; then add one ounce of salt and
two ounces of white sugar. When lukewarm stir in a gill of
liquid yeast or an ounce cake of compressed yeast dissolved
in warm water. Let stand twenty-four hours, stirring occasionally,
then cover closely, and set in a cool place. Yeast
made in this manner will keep sweet for two weeks in summer,
and much longer in winter, and can be used at any time
during that period for starting a fresh supply of yeast, as well
as for making bread.</p>

<p>The first step in bread making is the preparation of the ferment.</p>

<p>Pour gradually, stirring meanwhile, a quart of boiling water
upon half a pint of wheat flour. When the mixture has cooled
to about lukewarmness (80°) add a gill of yeast, stir well, cover
closely, and let stand till thoroughly light and a mass of white
foam. Taste it, and it bites like beer; stir it, and it seems to
dance and sparkle with exuberant life, while the odor it emits
is strongly alcoholic. Ferment can be kept for several hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
after it becomes light and foamy without growing sour, or appearing
to deteriorate in any manner. But it is better to use it
as soon as it reaches this stage, as it is then undoubtedly at its
very best estate. The time required for ferment to grow light,
varies from two to six hours, according to the strength of the
yeast put in it and the temperature of the place where it stands.
When due attention is given to these things, the custom of preparing
or “setting” ferment in the evening to be used in bread
making the next day is a convenient one; and, as it usually
proves satisfactory, is in no way objectionable.</p>

<p>When the ferment is perfectly light, beat vigorously into it
about half a pint of flour, cover, and leave to rise. By this
addition of flour the ferment is transformed into sponge, which,
under favorable conditions, will rise in from half an hour to an
hour. As soon as the sponge rises, add more flour, and give
it another beating; and so repeat each time it rises, until it
gets too stiff to be easily stirred.</p>

<p>The mixture is then dough, and is ready for working or
kneading. After it has been kneaded till flour is no longer
required to keep it from sticking to the molding board, it is of
the proper consistency for bread, and may be divided into four
equal parts, molded, or shaped into loaves, and put in greased
bread pans to rise for the last time, preparatory to baking; or
it may be set to rise in a mass before being divided into loaves.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to decide whether it is better to let the
dough rise in a mass or in separate loaves. Bread which
rises in a mass appears to be a trifle more elastic and spongy
than that which rises in separate loaves; but the latter seems
to excel the former in sweetness and delicacy of flavor. In
either case the bread will be good.</p>

<p>Two points in this mode of making bread deserve special
attention:</p>

<p>1. The flour is added repeatedly after intervals of fermentation,
and as it contains fresh food for the yeast, these frequent
additions of flour keep the yeast in a vigorous and healthy condition
during the entire period of bread making.</p>

<p>2. The fermentation is always arrested in the sponge and
dough before it arrives at the exhaustive point; for whenever
sponge or dough is allowed to reach its utmost limit of expansion
and fall back or “tumble in,” as it invariably does at this
crisis, it loses something of excellence that no after labor or
attention can restore.</p>

<p>Another method of making bread is to mix the yeast with
the wetting, and gradually add flour, working it meanwhile,
until the dough is of the proper consistency, when it should be
kneaded upon the molding board till smooth and elastic, and
then put to rise. Dough may be mixed in this manner late in
the evening, and, if not kept in too warm an atmosphere, will
be in proper condition for making into loaves, rolls, etc., at an
early hour the next morning.</p>

<p>Ferment, sponge and dough are all affected by atmospheric
changes, and should be mixed and kept in thick stone or
earthen vessels, and covered closely to exclude the air. And
care should be taken to keep them at the proper temperature,
which is about 75° during the entire process of bread making.
Fermentation is arrested at a temperature below 30°, proceeds
slowly at 50°, rapidly at 70°, very rapidly at 90°, and can be
hastened or retarded, if necessary, by increasing or diminishing
the temperature.</p>

<p>The quantity of flour necessary to make dough of the proper
consistency for bread depends considerably upon its quality,
and varies from two and a half to three measures of flour to
one measure of “wetting.” More flour can, however, be added,
and the dough made considerably stiffer, without perceptible
detriment. Dough for fancy bread and rolls should be quite stiff,
so as to retain any desired shape or form. Soft, spongy bread
possesses greater delicacy when freshly baked, but appears to
lose its moisture and grow stale much sooner than that which
is more compact.</p>

<p>The length of time required for kneading or working dough
is materially affected by the quality of the flour. Flour exposed
to the atmosphere deteriorates quite rapidly, and the
moisture it absorbs so impairs the tenacity of its gluten, that
bread of the best quality can not be made from it, in spite of
all the working and kneading that may be given to the dough.
Much less time is required kneading dough made from choice,
than from inferior brands of flour.</p>

<p>It is an established fact that dough is rendered tough and
elastic by working and kneading; but as the same result can
be accomplished sooner and less laboriously by pulling and
stretching, it is advisable, in making bread, to pull and stretch
as well as to work and knead the dough.</p>

<p>Bread dough may perhaps be kneaded a good deal with advantage,
but it is by no means certain that much kneading is
absolutely necessary for the production of the best quality of
bread. The fermentation, back of the kneading, gives life
and force to dough. When this is perfect, dough, in a suitable
condition for molding into loaves or rolls, shows a great
deal of resisting force. It seems, in fact, to have a <i>will of its
own</i>, and its determination to rise is almost irrepressible. You
may knead it in the most resolute manner and mold it into a
compact ball; but in a short time it will rise, and swell, and
spread, until it has doubled in dimensions. You may thrust
your fist fiercely into a batch of good dough, but the impression
you make upon it is by no means a lasting one. Almost
as soon as you draw back your hand it regains elasticity and
resumes its original position. This irrepressible spirit in dough
is the surest test of its goodness, and when perfectly developed
you can do as you please with the dough. You may roll it, or
twist it, or plait it, with the greatest ease. You can mold it into
any form without trouble. It does not stick to the hands or
the molding board. It is in its most amiable mood. It is perfectly
docile and obedient except in one respect—it can not be
put down and kept down; and any bread dough that can is
poor stuff that will never rise to distinction or win admiration.</p>

<p>Dough after having perfectly risen should not be kneaded
again. If in pans, it should be immediately baked. If in
mass, it should be divided into loaves or rolls, and gently
pulled, rolled or folded into shape, when it may also be put to
bake. These loaves or rolls will, however, be lighter and more
delicate if permitted to rise again before they are placed in the
oven. Much of the superior excellence of the Vienna imperial
roll is due to the peculiar manipulation the light dough is
subjected to just before it is placed in the baking pan.</p>

<p>The final and perhaps most important point in bread making
has been reached when the loaves are put in the pans to rise for
the last time. To decide when dough is just light enough to
bake is a very delicate and important matter. If it is put in
the oven a moment too soon, you fail to obtain the supreme
loaf to which you are entitled for your toil; and if permitted to
pass the point of perfect lightness you lose the best results of
your labor. The exact time required for loaves to rise after
they have been placed in the pans can not be given, as it varies
in different temperatures, at different seasons, and with
different brands of flour. But it is seldom less than half an
hour, or more than an hour and a half.</p>

<p>A loaf of bread should nearly double in size after it is put in
the pan; or if a deep gash be cut in the top of it, the incision
should disappear by the time the loaf has perfectly risen.
Bread, when light enough for baking, feels aerated all through;
and by lifting and weighing it in the hand one can generally
recognize the condition of lightness quite as accurately as by
sight.</p>

<p>The exercise of a little observation and judgment will soon
enable one to decide when dough has reached its best and
most perfect state of lightness. But where any doubt exists in
regard to the matter it is better to put it in the oven while rising
toward perfection than after it attains the altitude at which it
begins to retrograde.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potato Bread.</span>—Potato added to flour is generally supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
to improve the quality of the bread. That it does is unquestionably
true, where the flour used is of an inferior grade. “Of
all starches,” says Dr. Graham, “the starch found in the potato is
best adapted to the growth of yeast, and in using potato in
bread, bakers made practical application of a fact long before
chemists discovered it to be such.” Potatoes when used in
bread should be well boiled and smoothly mashed, and equal
portions of potato and flour be used in making the ferment.
The bread is then made in the same manner as when flour
alone is used.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whole Wheat Flour.</span>—It is claimed that bran in Graham
flour often proves an irritant to delicate digestive organs. In
whole wheat flour we have the entire food principle of the grain
without the hull. The cold blast process of milling gives us
this flour of a very superior quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whole Wheat Flour Bread</span> should be made in every
particular like patent or new process flour bread, and baked in
loaves, twists, or fancy rolls. It is very delicious baked in the
form of muffins and eaten warm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Graham Bread.</span>—The ferment for Graham bread should be
of white flour, and prepared in the same manner as the ferment
for white flour bread. When light add sugar and salt to
taste, and work in Graham flour until the dough becomes elastic
and clinging and is sufficiently stiff. Let stand till perfectly
risen; then shape into loaves by rolling gently under the hand
on a well floured molding-board, and place in greased baking
pans. Less flour is required in proportion to the “wetting”
for Graham than for white bread. And unless Graham dough
is of the proper consistency, the bread when baked will be
moist, sticky and insipid, or dry, rough and unpalatable. The
correct proportions are a little more than two measures of Graham
flour to one measure of “wetting.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oat, Corn and Barley Bread.</span>—Fermented bread can be
made of oat, corn, or barley meal, or flour; care being taken
to add wetting in proportion to the demands of the grain.
When corn or oat meal is used, boiling water should be poured
upon it and it be permitted to swell for at least an hour before
the yeast is added. These grains make delicious muffins and
bread to be eaten warm.</p>

<p>Pinhead oat meal, pearled barley, and corn grits, well
cooked and made into bread by adding whole wheat flour, can be
baked in muffin pans, or rolled thin and baked in crisp rolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rye Bread.</span>—The method of making rye bread is almost
identical with that for making wheat bread—from three to
three and a half measures of flour to one measure of “wetting”
being required. More time is necessary for it to ferment or
rise, and it will not become so light, spongy and elastic as wheat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston Brown Bread.</span>—Scald a pint of corn meal with a
pint of boiling water. When sufficiently cool add a pint and
a half of rye meal, a gill of yeast, a gill of molasses, and a
teaspoonful of salt. Mix well, and when perfectly risen steam
five hours, then put in the oven half an hour to dry and
harden the crust.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vienna Bread.</span>—To a pint of new milk, add a pint of
water, an ounce of compressed yeast, a teaspoonful of salt,
and flour sufficient to make a thin batter. Stir well and let
stand for an hour to rise, then work in flour until the dough is
the proper consistency for bread. When very light, which
will be in about three hours, divide and mold into loaves, and
set to rise in the bread pans; or shape into imperial rolls and
set to rise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imperial Rolls.</span>—Separate one of the Vienna loaves, detached
from the mass of dough, into ten or twelve irregular
pieces of the thickness of about half an inch. Take separately
each of these pieces in the left hand, and slightly stretch
with the thumb and forefinger of the right hand one of the
irregular points over the left thumb toward the center of the
roll. Repeat this operation, turning the piece of dough as it
proceeds, each time lifting the thumb and gently pressing it
upon the last fold until all the points have been drawn in,
when the roll can be placed to rise. If the folding has been
properly done, the roll when baked will be composed of a succession
of sheets or layers of delicate, tenacious crumb surrounded
with a thin crisp crust. The fingers can be slightly
greased to keep the dough from sticking to them while shaping
these rolls; but if it is of the proper consistency, it will not
stick to the hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baking Bread.</span>—When bread is ready for baking, it is desirable
to fix the air cells as soon as possible by heat; but it does
not follow that to do this it should be put in a very hot oven
and a crust immediately formed on the loaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Temperature of the Oven.</span>—The heat of the oven should
not be greatest when bread is put to bake; it should slightly
increase in intensity for about ten minutes, and after remaining
at a firm, steady temperature for that length of time should
gradually decrease till the baking is finished. The principal
change to be effected by the baking, which is the coagulation
of the albumen of the air cells, takes place at a temperature
somewhere near 212°, and as the temperature within the loaf can
not rise above that point, no changes go on there except those
produced by the watery vapor or steam. Flour, however, is
not browned except at a much higher temperature; hence a
greater degree of heat is necessary to properly bake the outside
of the loaf. During the period of baking bread the heat
of the oven should not rise above 570° nor fall below 240°.</p>

<p>An ordinary sized loaf of bread, with the oven at the proper
temperature, will bake thoroughly in an hour; a loaf the size
of one of the pans recommended, in about half an hour. But
as there are several hygienic and philosophical reasons why
bread should be well baked, it is better to err by leaving it in
the oven a little too long than not quite long enough.—<i>Bread
and Bread Making.</i></p>

<h2 id="THE_PAUPER_PROBLEM_IN_GERMANY">THE PAUPER PROBLEM IN GERMANY.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY BISHOP JOHN F. HURST.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The poorest Germans one sees are not here in Germany, but
on the American side of the Atlantic, at Castle Garden and other
landing places. All hours of the day and night I have been along
the German thoroughfares of travel, and yet I can not recall that
any one has put out his hand for alms, or that few have presented
the appearance of extreme penury. There is no question
that there has been a wonderful coming up of the general
industrial life of Germany since the consolidation of the countries,
and since the leadership of Bismarck has thrust new force
into every part of the national civilization. But what with all
the absorption of a million of men into the national army, and
the coming and going from civil into military life of all the
young in the land, there are multitudes to whom bread is the
one supreme thought. There are millions for whom there must
be work to-day for the loaf of to-morrow. There are two
questions which constantly monopolize the thought of the
Prussian government—to keep safe against the French, who do
not forget the loss of Alsace and Lorrain, in 1871, and, then,
how to keep the workingmen busy. Why all this talk about
German colonies? Why does Prussia, with only a strip of the
North Sea for its only outlet to the ocean, fill its days of Parliament
and its periodical press, with discussions as to how to
get more land, on some distant coast, where colonies may be
planted? It is simply to furnish, as does India for Britain, an
outlet for trade. Why did the old Kaiser Wilhelm, only the
other day, declare that he had spent his reign in trying to develop
the internal policy of the country, but that to his son and
successor, Friedrich Wilhelm, would belong the mission of developing
the German colonist policy? He meant, as does every
Hohenzollern, that his people should be busy in peace, and therefore
strong for war. But while there are few evidences in public
of extreme poverty in Germany, and while there has been a singular
elevation of the general cheerfulness of the lower classes,
there is real pauperism, and a plenty of it. But it is not allowed
to come to the light. No shrewder piece of management
has ever been accomplished in Germany than the skillful
dealing with the veritable pauper within the last ten years. It
is as nearly a perfect work as one ever saw performed upon the
man in rags. It is as exquisite an adjustment of legal and
voluntary measures, an interlacing of what people choose to
do and what they are compelled to do, as the sun shines
on. But this must be said: the government could not manage
the pauper alone. It was too great a task for even Bismarck
and the Emperor. Christian people have done it, and of their
own free will. In 1880 a body of earnest people, many of them
evangelical Christians, formed themselves into an association
for the care of the poor and for beneficiaries. Scattered societies
had already existed, and for a long time. For example,
in 1840, Gustav Werner founded an institution for the relief of
the poor of Wurtemburg, which has grown into a mammoth
affair, and now numbers one hundred and twenty-four houses
for labor. Other benevolent spirits had followed in his footsteps.
But here in Germany the watchword is now consolidation, and
so the efforts to solve the pauper problem have been combined.
The association which came into being only four years ago, to
help the poor out of their misery, has held annual sessions,
collected important statistics, presented themes for better
methods, and has rallied to the standard men of the strongest
hands and keenest minds in the Fatherland. They have told
the government some things that the census taker knows nothing
about. Each report of their annual meeting is a stout volume,
and a more useful document can hardly be found in the
current literature of even literary Germany.</p>

<p>I have said that there is but little semblance of extreme pauperism—the
actual putting out the hand for the coppers with
which to buy bread and cast off clothes. But this retirement
of the pauper from public gaze is a new thing. What has he
been doing? Until very lately, to every German square mile,
which is four times the English mile, there were ten beggars,
who averaged a mark, or twenty-five cents, a day, by the desperate
plying of their craft. Now, the German empire covers
just space enough to make the voluntary gifts to beggars
amount to 36,500,000 marks, or $9,125,000. This state of things
existed in much grosser forms when the gifts were simply enormous,
until very recently, and since the beginning of the efforts
to solve the question of beggary.</p>

<p>But the one great thing that has come to light, and which is
now presented to the German people with tremendous force, is
this: the cause of the pauperism is intemperance. This revelation
has been slow in coming, but it has come at last, and the
statistics show that where there is most beer there is most beggary.
Hence the efforts made to do away with public pauperism
touch upon the still broader and deeper one of intemperance.</p>

<p>The desperation of the beggar is well known. Here in Germany
they have a proverb:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Es ist und bleibt die alte Geschicht;</div>
<div class="verse">Wer betteln kann verhungert nicht.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Which, rendered strictly, runs about thus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The old story—we have it still;</div>
<div class="verse">The beggar’s sure to have his fill.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But the efforts now made, by the banding into one great organization
all associations for caring for the poor, are directed
toward the actual disarming of the beggar by giving him work,
and making him work, no matter how he comes by his beggary.
The government comes in to aid the voluntary efforts,
and enacts laws against the asking for alms, and any one offending
is in danger of the work colony. The general public
are not only cautioned against giving to a pauper, but are informed
that it is an actual damage to the State and to the recipient.
The government, of course, has nothing to say about
the great cause of vagabondism—namely, intemperance. But
no one now denies it. It is a confirmed thing, in every rank,
that it is beer which makes the 100,000 beggars of the German
empire. Various measures have been resorted to in order to
cure intemperance. The one adopted in a Hessian town deserves
the credit of originality. The name of any person found
under the influence of liquor was posted on a public bulletin,
so that every passer by, and even the school children, could
read it. The effect has been marvelous. Previously, public
drunkenness was common there, and even people otherwise
respectable were found reeling along the streets. But so great
has been the change that public intemperance has been driven
from the place.</p>

<p>But what is now done with the German beggar? He is given
work, such as he can do, and is paid for it. The whole land is
getting to be covered with groups of paupers, or “colonies,” who
soon lose the odious name and business, and are getting gradually
converted into respectable and thriving citizens, and becoming
absorbed into the surrounding population. The German believes
that beggary is a mania, and grows upon one like any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other vice or craze, and that it must be broken up. But the
gentlest measures are adopted. Such work is offered as is congenial.
The hours are adjusted to the person’s age and ability.
If the pauper is an invalid, even that feature is cared for. His
family is considered, and made a special study. His work
seems to be paid for at a fair rate, and he hardly knows, from
anything he sees or hears, that he has ever been a beggar. If,
after leaving the colony, he relapses into beggary, his labor becomes
more enforced, and assumes the firmer form of a penalty.
Is it not about time that, in all countries, we look at the
beggar with a sympathy broad enough to show him the way to
care for himself, and to make to him the great revelation that
even for him, with all his rags and habit of taking alms, there
is still a possible manhood?</p>

<h2 id="ROMANCE_VERSUS_REALITY">ROMANCE VERSUS REALITY.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY MISS FRANCES E. WILLARD,<br />
President of W. C. T. U.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Much as I disliked the restriction then, I am now sincerely
grateful that my Puritan father not only commanded me not
to read novels, but successfully prohibited the temptation
from coming in his children’s way. Until I was fifteen years
old I never saw a volume of the kind. “Pilgrim’s Progress”
was the nearest approach we made, but it seems profanation
to refer to that choice English classic in this degenerate connection.
[I should add that Rev. Dr. Tefft’s “Shoulder
Knot” was also early read at our house, in the <i>Ladies’ Repository</i>;
but, then, that delightful work was a <i>historical</i> story,
and even my father praised it.]</p>

<p>A kind and garrulous seamstress who declared that
this law of our household was “a shame,” told us what she
could remember of “The Children of the Abbey,” and finally
brought in, surreptitiously, “Jane Eyre” and “Thaddeus of
Warsaw.” But the glamor of those highly seasoned pages
was unhealthful and made “human nature’s daily food,” the
common pastoral life we led, and nature’s soothing beauty
seem so tame and tasteless that the revulsion was my life’s
first sorrow. How evanescent and unreal was the pleasure of
such reading; a sort of spiritual hasheesh eating with hard
and painful waking; a benumbing of the healthful, every-day
activities of life; a losing of so much that was simple and
sweet, to gain so little that was, at best, a fevered and fantastic
vision of utter unreality. In all the years since then I have
believed that novel writing, save for some high, heroic moral
aim, while the most diversified, is the most unproductive of all
industries! The young people who read the greatest quantity
of novels know the least, and are the dullest in aspect, and the
most vapid in conversation. The flavor of individuality has
been burnt out of them, always imagining themselves in an
artificial relation to life, always content to look through their
author’s glasses, they become as commonplace as pawns upon
a chess board. “Sir, we had good talk!” was Sam Johnson’s
highest praise of any whom he met. But any talk save the
dreariest commonplace and most tiresome reiteration is impossible
with the regulation reader of novels or player of
games. And this is, in my judgment, because God, by the
very laws of mind, must punish those who <i>kill</i> time instead of
<i>cultivating</i> it. For time is the stuff that life is made of; the
crucible of character, the arena of achievement, and woe to
those who fritter it away. They can not help paying great
nature’s penalty, and “mediocre,” “failure,” or “imbecile”
will surely be stamped upon their foreheads. Therefore I
would have each generous youth and maiden say to every
story-spinner, except the few great names that can be
counted on the fingers of one hand: “I really can not
patronize your wares, and will not furnish you my head for a
football, or my fancy for a sieve. By writing these books you
get money and a fleeting, unsubstantial fame, but by reading
them I should turn my possibility of success in life to the certainty
of failure. <i>Myself plus time</i> is the capital stock with
which the good Heavenly Father has pitted me against the
world to see if I can gain some foothold. I can not afford to
be a mere spectator. I am a wrestler for the laurel in life’s
Olympian games. I can make history, why should I maunder
in a hammock and read the endless repetitions of romance?
No, find yourself a cheaper pattern, for I count myself too
valuable for the sponge-like use that you would put me to.”</p>

<p>Nay, I would have our young people reach a higher key than
this. Because of life’s real story with its mystery and pathos;
because of the romance that crowds into every year; the plot
that thickens daily, and the tragedy that lies a little way beyond;
because of Christ and his kingdom—the mightiest
drama of the ages, let us be up and doing with a heart for any
fate. Humanity is worth our while; to love, to bless, to work
for it.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These ought to be the bread of life to us, the tireless inspiration
of each full day of honest toil. God meant this to be so,
for only thus do we cease chasing about for happiness, and
find blessedness instead.</p>

<p>I thought, while fresh in mind, to sketch a real, live, every-day
romance of which my heart is full; and I ask true hearts
to cherish the impetus it is capable of giving toward noble
character and Christlike deeds.</p>

<h3>THE O’ER-TRUE TALE.</h3>

<p>One stormy evening about thirty-five years ago a gentleman
of lithe figure and alert face answered the door-bell of his
spacious home in Portland, Maine. A lady stood before him
closely veiled, who, on entering the cheery sitting-room where
the gentleman and his wife had been cozily seated around the
evening lamp, proved to be the latter’s girlhood friend. She
had come on the saddest errand that woman’s misery ever
compels. What she divulged was none the less a secret to
her loyal heart because an open secret to her neighbors. It
was the old, old story of an inebriate husband who had not
come home for days, and whose business situation was forfeited,
and children on the threshold of want. She closed by
giving the location of the saloon where she had reason to believe
him concealed, and pitifully murmured, turning to Neal
Dow (for it was he), “Can’t you find my husband, and won’t
you bring him home?”</p>

<p>In his own decisive fashion Mr. Dow sought the saloon,
found the two-fold victim of inherent appetite and outward
temptation, and asked the saloon keeper’s aid in conveying
the half-unconscious man to the carriage. To his astonishment
this was refused in tones of anger, and the declaration
made that he had better attend to his own business, no man
liked this impertinent interference, and the saloon keeper certainly
did not propose to get the ill will of his best patron.
He also pointed to his license hanging on the wall; said he
paid a good sum for the privilege of selling, and meant to get
his money back with interest. This was Neal Dow’s first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
interview with a saloon keeper, and it aroused all the indignation
of his upright nature and all the energies of his undaunted
will. Turning to go he fired this Parthian arrow at
the vender: “So you mean to tell me that you’ll go right on
selling to this man?” and receiving an explosively affirmative
reply, he added: “<i>The people of the State of Maine will see
if you will keep on selling.</i>” From that time the grand old
“Father of Prohibitory Law” took for his motto, “This one
thing I do.” He associated good men with him; traveled
over the state in his own carriage; spoke in school houses and
wherever he could get admission; in his own phrase he
“sowed the State of Maine knee-deep with temperance literature;”
the common people heard him gladly; the caucus
decided to send men to the legislature who would represent
the people’s will in this supreme decision, and on the 26th of
May, 1851, prohibition became the legal method of the Pine
Tree State in reference to the liquor traffic.</p>

<p>During the great discussion that preceded this action three
legislators were whittling, whistling and discussing “how it
was best to vote.” Two of them said they should be struck
with political lightning if they voted for the new law, but the
third—“Farmer Skillig” was his name, I think—declared, in
the honest, downright tones of the average “legislator with
hay-seed in his hair,” that this was the right sort of a law,
and he’d vote for it and take his chances. Sequel: The time
servers were never heard of more, after they had served their
time, but Farmer Skillig flourished on and on in the legislature
like the green bay tree.</p>

<p>Last summer I met on the shore of Puget’s Sound, where he
is a leading citizen of Olympia, capital of Washington Territory,
Captain Hall, who told me a suggestive incident about
the famous “Maine law.” It seems the bill was passed on
Saturday, and the (Democratic) Governor Hubbard being absent
from the capital over Sunday, it was feared the saloon
interest would search out and destroy the legal copy, and as
the date of adjournment was close at hand, the subject might
be laid over for a year. True to their instincts, the liquor men
did their best to find the “only true copy,” forcing their way
into the State House on the Sabbath, breaking open desks,
etc., but Captain Hale, who was a member of the House, had
taken the precious “bill” under his care and carried it in his
breast pocket until the Governor’s return, when his signature
was promptly affixed and the law was safe. Four years later,
by one of those “reactions” of which history is full, a license
law was substituted, which, after two years of trial was overthrown,
and by overwhelming majorities prohibition came
again and took up its peaceful and permanent abode in
Maine.</p>

<p>Like every other law it has been constantly strengthened by
the introduction of better machinery for enforcement. The
“search and seizure clauses” have greatly energized the executive
arm; the outlawing of “clubs,” the including of cider,
the provision for a constabulary force to be appointed by the
Governor on application from a county—all these “cogs in the
wheel” are a terror to evil doers, but a praise to them
that do well. And now what has this law wrought out for
Maine? It has driven every distillery and brewery out of the
state. It has so decreased crime that Maine has less of it in
proportion than any other state in the Union. Its state’s
prison, by recent showing, had but 400 inmates, or only one in
every sixteen hundred (1,600) inhabitants. In the same year
Massachusetts had one to every four hundred and sixty of her
population. It has decreased internal revenue receipts from
the manufacture and sale of alcoholics to an average of seven
cents to each person, while in the United States at large the
average is one dollar and seventy-one cents per capita.</p>

<p>Many newspapers edited in the interest of license have circulated
the report that Maine leads off in the number of persons
arrested, according to its population, but artfully concealed
the fact that so large a number of these arrests are not
for what a license state calls “crime,” but are for selling intoxicating
liquors at all!</p>

<p>In 1882 the United States revenue report shows that while
$1.71 per inhabitant were collected in the whole Union, only 4
cents per inhabitant were collected in Maine. Prohibitory
Maine has about the same population as license New Jersey;
yet the liquor tax in the former state is only 3 cents per inhabitant,
while in the latter state it is $2.40, and in the country at
large $1.83. In reply to the assertion that tobacco and opium
eating are taking the place of liquor drinking in Maine, I
may mention that <i>the tobacco tax paid by Maine is only 17
cents per inhabitant, while the average for the country is $1.00
per inhabitant</i>; and that opium eating is far less prevalent
here than in other eastern states.</p>

<p>This analysis might be carried on indefinitely with equally
satisfactory results in answering the question: What has prohibition
done for Maine?</p>

<p>In 1876 Hon. Henry W. Blair, of New Hampshire, introduced
to the people of the United States the idea of constitutional
prohibition, and offered in Congress an amendment to
the National Constitution prohibiting the traffic in strong drink.
Coming from a source so prominent, and following so soon
upon the woman’s crusade, this idea was like the spark to
tinder, being caught up with zeal in all parts of the nation, and
petitions have since been addressed to almost every state
legislature, as well as annually presented to the National Congress.
In 1880 the people of Kansas voted upon this question,
giving eight thousand majority for prohibition; in 1882 Iowa
gave thirty thousand, and in 1883 Ohio cast three hundred and
thirty thousand votes for, and only ninety thousand against
constitutional prohibition, but was “counted out” by party
manipulation, as the temperance people publicly declare.
Practically, then, the jury of the people has passed sentence
against the liquor traffic every time that the great chancery
suit of “<span class="smcap">Home versus Saloon</span>” has been submitted to them.
Meanwhile, “the mother of us all” in prohibition work was
Maine, and the whole temperance host, both within and beyond
that noble old pioneer state, felt that she should not be
outdone by her daughters of the newer New England in the
West. And so petitions poured in on the legislature of Maine
asking for the submission of an amendment to the constitution
which should ground the prohibitory principle in the state’s
organic law. This request was at first declined, not from
antagonism to prohibition itself, for neither party dare attack
that by any open declaration, but on the ground that since the
fathers fell asleep all things might well continue as they were;
new fangled ideas were well enough for new regions, but said
the average politician,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The good old ways are good enough for me.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">Still the temperance people urged that Maine should not be
outdone; that she should march with the age; that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“New occasions teach new duties,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Time makes ancient good uncouth;</div>
<div class="verse i1">They must upward still and onward,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Who would keep abreast of truth.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">More than this, it was argued that constitutional prohibition
has many advantages over local and statutory prohibition,
and against it no good or logical objections have ever been
made, although the organs, attorneys and friends of the saloon
have said and written much.</p>

<p>Constitutional prohibition is superior to statutory because it
is more democratic and best accords with the idea of republicanism.
The friends of temperance, unlike the distillers,
brewers and retailers, are <i>willing to trust the people</i>.</p>

<p>Constitutional prohibition is superior to statutory because it
is a more certain and perfect expression of public sentiment;
because it carries with it greater weight and dignity; because
it is non-partisan (though it requires before it a party to submit,
and after it a party to enforce).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Constitutional prohibition best accords with correct principles
of law-making, the constitution being a general statement
of principles, rights and obligations. It can not be repealed
by the legislature, since every member of that body on being
“qualified” raises his hand in solemn oath that he will defend
the constitution. It holds the law already on the statute
book as with a clinched nail, and therefore furnishes a stronger
cage and better lock for the tiger of license and the lion of
taxation. If it does not kill him it chains the mad dog of rum
and beer with a short chain and puts up a sign—<span class="smcapuc">THIS IS A MAD
DOG!</span> So that few will go near him and <i>nobody can let him
loose without the consent of the people</i>.</p>

<p>For these reasons, and many others cogently set forth by
Rev. H. C. Munson, Secretary of the Maine Temperance
Alliance, the people pursued the legislature and the amendment
was submitted at its last session. Public interest was at
once concentrated on Maine; nor in America alone, but
wherever English is spoken the heart of the people was aroused.
From New Zealand came a letter to Hon. John B. Finch, the
great prohibition orator and chief Good Templar of the world.
It read in this fashion: “We hear that the parliament in your
province of Maine has submitted prohibition to a vote of the
people to know if after thirty years’ trial they think it the best
method of handling the liquor traffic. Tell them for the sake
of humanity to stand by their law, for a vote in Maine counts
one in New Zealand either for or against outlawing the dram
shop.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Emily Pitt Stevens, the gifted California lady who came
to help in the campaign said: “If you defeat the prohibition
amendment I can not go back to my vineyard-cursed state, and
tell them so, but prefer to be buried face downward under a
lone pine in the state that went back on its record.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Pearson, vice president of the Woman’s Temperance
Association of England, and associate of its president, Margaret
Lucas (sister of John Bright), declared that if Maine
failed she would be glad that three thousand miles of brine
separated her from the faces she would have no courage to
look into. And so on every side rang the refrain of warning.
Three hundred speakers went up and down through the state,
most of them “to the manor born,” nearly all freely giving
their services. This was perhaps our most effective argument
as “speakers from a distance.”</p>

<p>Your verdict will be that of the whole Anglo-Saxon race.
Sometimes a part stands for the whole, and to-day you are the
world’s jury. Arnold of Winkelried stood for all the republics
of the wide world. Luther stood for all Protestants. The men
at Gettysburg stood for the nation. Who will ask, or who
remember what man was chosen Governor in Maine this year?
Only a handful of people for a little time, but humanity cares
what decision you give on the outlawing of those dealers who
would sell alcoholic poison as a drink, because we are in the
midst of the great fight for a clear brain, and everybody has a
vital interest that victory shall be won.</p>

<p>The “sword marks” of John B. Finch were everywhere;
Mary A. Woodbridge, chieftain of Ohio’s gigantic battle, told
how fields were won; Col. Chevis, a gallant Southron, “who
served under Stonewall Jackson,” but whom the temperance
cause has reconstructed, did admirable service. Mrs.
McLaughlin, with her winsome eloquence; Mrs. Kimball,
with her polished style; Mrs. Lucy H. Washington, with her
rapier-like logic, all were there. Ministers of every denomination
entered the field; a Catholic priest “stumped” one of
the fifteen counties; the temperance societies were a unit in
their devotion, and while the seething caldron of politics was
at its height, the temperance campaign, perfectly distinct, went
on beside it; with prayers instead of processions, torches of
truth rather than pine knots, and “Coronation” instead of
“We’ll vote for Blaine and Robie.”</p>

<p>Speaking in eleven chief towns on as many successive nights
I found the W. C. T. U. had worked up the meetings with
great care. For “a success” in this line does not “happen,”
but is organized, preëmpted, captured by consecrated common
sense. I can readily tell a meeting that is a work of art
and “made up of every creature’s best” from one thrown together
with a pitch-fork. In most towns they had the opera
house and banked up the stage with flowers; in one there was
a veritable hedge of golden rod; in nearly all the cross and
flag were foremost, side by side, and our W. C. T. U. motto,
“For God and Home and Native Land” was sometimes in gilt
letters on emerald velvet, others in delicate tracery of decorative
work, or in evergreen on a white ground. Always they
gave our anthem of the national W. C. T. U., composed by
Drs. J. E. Rankin and Bischoff, of Washington, and beginning:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘For God and Home and Native Land,’</div>
<div class="verse i1">Our motto here we write it;</div>
<div class="verse i1">There is no foe we’ll not withstand,</div>
<div class="verse i1">No battle but we’ll fight it.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At Belfast the ladies had turned the Unitarian Church into a
bower of beauty with potted plants in every window, the national
colors in great folds above the people’s heads, mottoes
in profusion, and on a table below the tall, old fashioned pulpit
they had placed a veritable ballot box, borrowed from the
town clerk, and poised over it a snow white dove with a “Yes”
ballot in its beak. When I saw that latest “witty invention”
of the unrepresented class it seemed to me pathetic beyond
words, and so eloquent that no matter how spent might be the
arrow of my speech, the voters must give heed to its appeal.</p>

<p>Thus gently and patiently wrought the W. C. T. U. of Maine
under its beloved leader, Mrs. L. M. N. Stevens, of Portland,
who has been for years the foremost temperance figure in the
state, except Neal Dow, and whose mingled strength and gentleness
outrank that famous leader in the people’s heart. Four
days prior to the voting Mrs. Stevens presided over the annual
convention of the W. C. T. U., held in the town of Gardiner,
for the purpose of final and concerted action as to what should
be done at the polls. Nothing proves more plainly the profound
hold of the temperance reform upon the heart of woman,
nor more surprisingly demonstrates the change in public sentiment,
than the willingness of these conservative women of the
church to go directly to the polls. At first they counseled with
their western sisters who knew the methods pursued in Iowa,
Ohio, and other states, but Mrs. Woodbridge suggested nothing
beyond renting vacant rooms near the voting precincts,
serving refreshments there, and giving out votes to those who
passed that way. My own observations in Iowa were of similar
character. I was in Marion, Iowa, on the 27th of June,
1882, their voting day, where an all day prayer meeting was
held; the children marched and sang, the lunch was served,
and out of nine hundred voters, eight hundred votes were cast
for the amendment. But we women were like Mary’s little
lamb, and “waited patiently about” till the voters came to
lunch, though sending out the children with amendment ballots
and bouquets. When these methods were suggested the
ladies quietly said, “But the leading men in our towns think it
important that we should see the votes go in, for they say
‘there’s many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip’ in this matter,
and our ‘Yes’ ballot might be cast aside when the men had
left our presence.” It goes without saying that the western
sisters did not discourage those brave women, but rejoiced in
these modern Baraks who had said, “If thou wilt go with me I
will go up,” and the brave Deborahs who had answered, “I
will surely go with thee.”</p>

<p>Among the methods chosen was an address to the voters
asking them to represent their home constituency, to be sent
out just before the portentious September 8th, “a day for which
all other days were made,” as it seemed to those earnest hearts.
With this address plenty of “Yes” ballots were to be inclosed
for the “vest pocket vote,” unknown to any save the man who
casts it, is often a factor of power. Mrs. Woodbridge told the
ladies that in Ohio they decorated tent, booth, or rooms of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
W. C. T. U. with mottoes, and had prominently in view a large
Bible, on a pulpit cushion, which, without preconcerted action,
was almost always open to Isaiah v., with the passage marked:
“Woe unto him that justifieth the wicked for a reward.”</p>

<p>A delegation of ladies came four hundred miles to attend
this convention, from Aroostook county, which covers a larger
area than the State of Massachusetts. The W. C. T. U. in that
county has “conquered a peace,” and is the right arm of the
enforcing power. They reported that one hundred Scandinavians
had become naturalized for the express purpose of voting
“Yes” on the prohibition amendment.</p>

<p>Among the resolutions passed by this convention was the
following (an exact copy of the one adopted by our National
W. C. T. U. at its last session): “Resolved, That we will lend
our influence to that party, by whatever name called, which
furnishes the best embodiment of prohibition principles, and
will most surely protect our homes.” In the evening we had a
meeting under the trees in the town park, where thousands
congregated, and the full moon looked down on us, an emblem
of the purity and elevation that characterize our cause. Though
the street population was out in force, there was perfect quiet
and decorum, and not one whiff of tobacco smoke sullied the
pleasant air.</p>

<p>And now the fateful day wore on apace. Fortunately the
Sabbath came just before, and representative clergymen of all
denominations, including the Universalist and Catholic, Episcopal
and Unitarian, had united to request that every pulpit
should be a temperance Gatling gun that day, to send into the
pews a steady fire of intelligent conviction. From the circular
I take this sentence, which furnishes the key of the campaign
everywhere: “One thing we very much desire: <i>that there
should come over our people next Sunday a deep and solemn
feeling that this is God’s battle with sin</i>.”</p>

<p>The waking thought of the white-ribbon host in Maine can
readily be guessed: “God grant us good weather to-day.”
What was that but another way of wishing for the best light on
this last act of a great drama, only this was no mimic stage,
but one on which the measureless hope and uplift of humanity
were to be exhibited for all the world to see? Woman’s secret
prayer was to be transmuted by spiritual alchemy into manhood’s
sturdy resolve; the cherished hope of the gentle was to
become the stern decision of the strong; the “cause” was to
radiate out from temperance ministry and Band of Hope into
the wide, free area of a mighty Commonwealth. Let me give
from telegrams, letters, and newspapers, a few pulses out of the
people’s heart that day soon after noon:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Portland, Me.</span></p>

<p>Be of good cheer, all goes well. My faith claims a majority of fifty
thousand.</p>

<p class="sig"><span class="smcap">Mrs. L. M. N. Stevens.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bath, Me.</span></p>

<p>At nine o’clock a. m., one hour before the voting, the church bells
rang out their call for the friends of temperance to assemble and pray.
Meetings largely attended, and conducted by the pastors. Ladies went
to ward rooms to distribute “Yes” ballots.</p>

<p>A delegation of eight young ladies were present at West Bath with
bouquets for all who would vote for the amendment. “Yes,” sixty-six;
“No,” one.</p>

<p>One young toper voted the “Yes” ballot and the prohibition ticket
straight.</p>

<p>The boys of the Cold Water Army parade to-night with torches to
celebrate the victory in Bath. Five hundred and six majority for the
amendment. Praise meeting at headquarters.</p>

<p>It was amusing to watch the men in ward five go down stairs to
smoke their pipes. They did not like to do this in the presence of the
ladies who remained until the close of the polls.</p>

<p>The distributors of the “No” ticket were very scarce. In one ward
a fellow passed them for awhile, but felt so lonesome that he gave it up.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bangor, Me.</span></p>

<p>A barge, bearing appropriate mottoes, filled with children, was
mounted on a wagon, drawn by four black horses, and driven by a well
known citizen, from one polling place to another, and the way those
young folks sung “For God and Home and Native Land” was a caution
to the rummies! Button-hole bouquets were presented to “Yes”
voters by the ladies. Ice water was furnished at each polling place by
the W. C. T. U. Not a man was arrested for drunkenness or disturbance,
and “Wicked Bangor,” which was given up as “sure to go no,”
even by the temperance people, counts 1,718 “Yes” against 1,146 “No.”
Praise ye the Lord.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Augusta.</span></p>

<p>Seven wards; three to six women at each all day. Gov. A. P. Morrill
called on Mrs. Dr. Quinby, President W. C. T. U., and said he had
never known an election so orderly and pleasant. He and others attributed
it to the presence of the ladies. He wished they could deposit
ballots in their own right. Mrs. Q.’s sons, fourteen and nineteen years
of age, went with her to the different wards. One pastor escorted his
wife to the polls.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Portland.</span></p>

<p>Ladies had a tent in Market Square; decorated the polling places with
flowers; gave out votes and copies of amendment; gave bouquets to
temperance voters; in ward four about every other young man had this
decoration in button-hole.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Skowhegan.</span></p>

<p>We have heard from twenty-one towns; our majority is 2,378. Surely
God has moved upon the hearts of men in this great crisis.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Presque Isle.</span></p>

<p>Our great day is over. We have three hundred and fifty three for the
amendment, fifty-seven against it. We had our national motto framed
and trimmed with flowers, and a big “Yes” vote in the center. This
hung directly behind the ballot-box.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">North Anson.</span></p>

<p>We had one hundred and eighty-eight “Yes” to twenty-three “No.” God
has blessed us far beyond our hopes. All our people are astonished at
so large a majority. Many men told me they were surprised at the softening
influence the women had over those profane, rough men. There
was no rude word all day.</p>

<p>One town in Aroostook county cast one hundred and eighty-two “Yes”
and two “No.” Its total political vote was one hundred and ninety-three.

<p>I do not know how the foregoing extracts read to those fond

they are so real, so true-hearted, so full of humanity’s sacred
aspiration toward a Golden Age</p>

<p class="unindent">It is record of heart-words. So far as I have learned, all the
temperance societies of the state had but twelve hundred dollars
to spend—five hundred given by Dr. R. H. McDonald, of
California, and seven hundred from the Grand Lodge of Good
Templars. The rank and file won the victory, and I believe
the inspiration of their work was this motto given by the president
of their state W. C. T. U. at the Gardiner Convention:
<i>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit. So shall
ye be my disciples.</i></p>

<p>What is the lesson Maine can teach? It is expressed in the

an appeal to the intellect through argument, to the heart
through sympathy, to the conscience through the motives of
religion. The traffic in those poisons can best be handled by
prohibitory law.”</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY CHANCELLOR M. B. GOFF,<br />
Western University of Pennsylvania.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE SUN</h3>

<p class="unindent">Has again returned to about the same place that it occupied
this time last year; and as a result, we find that it
rises and sets within a minute or two of the times given on the
1st, 16th, and 30th of last November. For the present month,
it rises at 6:31, 6:48, and 7:04 a. m., and sets at 4:57, 4:41,
and 4:34 p. m., respectively, on the dates mentioned. We
find also that on the 16th day breaks as late as 5:11 a. m.
Other phenomena connected with the sun are as follows: On
the 4th, at 3:00 p. m., it is in superior conjunction with Mercury,
rendering of course by its great brilliancy that little
planet invisible. On the 13th it is in opposition to Neptune;
that is, 180° distant. So that, on that date, the planet might
be said to rise as the sun sets, or set as the sun rises. On the
20th, at 3:00 a. m., it is 90° east of Jupiter, so that if both had
the same declination Jupiter must rise about six hours before
the sun. But since the declination of Jupiter is north while
that of the sun is south, the former actually rises nearly eight
hours before the latter.</p>

<h3>THE MOON</h3>

<p class="unindent">Exhibits the following phases: Full on the 3d, at 3:28 a. m.;
last quarter on the 9th, at 6:04 p. m.; new moon on the 17th, at
1:03 p. m.; and first quarter on the 25th, at 5:08 p. m. On the
16th, it rises at 5:31 a. m.; on the 1st, it sets at 4:18 a. m.; and
on the 30th, sets at 4:11 a. m. Is nearest the earth on the 4th,
at 10:36 a. m., and farthest away on the 19th, at 9:12 p. m.
The sun and moon play an important part, in fact, are the sole
cause, as is believed, of a singular phenomenon observable in
our largest bodies of water. We refer to the <span class="smcap">Tides</span>, which are
an alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean, at
regular intervals. These have their greatest and least elevation
twice a day, and are called <i>High</i> and <i>Low Tides</i>; twice
a month, called <i>Spring</i> and <i>Neap Tides</i>; and also twice a
year. The rising of the tide is called the <i>Flood</i> and the falling
the <i>Ebb</i> tide. Similar tides, whether high or low, occur on
opposite sides of the earth at the same time. Thus, if it is
high tide at New York it is high tide 180° from New York. The
same is true of low tides. The interval between two successive
high tides is about twelve hours and twenty-five minutes; or,
if we regard the tidal wave as passing entirely around the
earth, it would each day reach the same meridian about fifty
minutes later than on the preceding day. So that they occur
in the course of time, at all hours of the night and day. Now,
it is often very important to know just when they will take
place. For example, a vessel wishing to enter a harbor where
the water is ordinarily too shallow to let her pass, may propose
to take advantage of high tide to make her mooring. It has
been found that the connection between the tides and the motions
of the sun and moon is so intimate that the one evidently
depend upon the others, and so accurately has the relation
been established that it is a matter of comparative ease to
estimate the height of the tide at any given time on any coast
of the world. The cause of the tides is the attracting power
of the sun and moon. On the principle of universal gravitation
the earth is drawn toward these two bodies, and were it a
solid mass, all the body would move equally toward them; but
as it is partly liquid, and as the attraction of all its parts is not
equal, the liquid parts nearest the bodies move faster than the
solid part; while the liquid part furthest away not being attracted
so strongly as the solid part is left behind, and thus at
the same time two waves are formed on opposite sides of the
globe. Such tides as these would be called High Tides. At
the moment of high water at any given place, the water is, as
it were, piled up. And as the amount of water on the earth’s
surface is constant, at 90° from this place the waters must be
shallower, and thus low tides are created. The foregoing
results would be produced, if the sun and moon had the same
longitude or if their longitudes differed by 180°. Since these
relative positions each occur once at least every month, there
are each month two Spring Tides. But there also occurs twice
each month a period when the sun and moon are 90° from each
other; then instead of their united influence being exerted, it
is divided, and the attractions are at right angles to each other.
Thus are produced what are called <i>neap</i> tides. The attraction
of the sun upon the earth is vastly greater than that of the
moon, but on account of the greater <i>inequality</i> of the moon’s
attraction, its influence in producing tides is really three times
as great as that of the sun. Nor is the tidal wave always directly
under the moon, but follows it at various distances, depending
much upon the depth of water, the regularity of the channel,
the size of the ocean, and the coast along which it moves.</p>

<h3>MERCURY,</h3>

<p class="unindent">On the 4th, in superior conjunction with, and on the 16th, at
5:00 a. m., at its greatest distance from the sun; while on the
18th, at 3:53 a. m., it will be 5° 18′ south of the moon. It
will rise on the 1st at 6:29 a. m.; on the 16th, at 7:29 a. m.; and
on the 30th, at 8:26 a. m., and set on the corresponding days
at 4:47, 4:51, and 5:14 p. m., being a morning star for the first
four days and evening star for the remainder of the month,
and perhaps visible to the naked eye on the last day. Motion
for the month direct, and amounting to 46° 56′ 44″. Diameter
increases from 4.6″ to 5″.</p>

<h3>VENUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Continues to reign queen of the morning, rising, however,
later each day, and rapidly moving to her superior conjunction,
her diameter diminishing 3.2″ in twenty-nine days. Her times
for rising are these: On the 1st, 3:02 a. m.; on the 16th, 3:31
a. m.; and on the 30th, 4:00 a. m. On the 4th, at 6:00 a. m.,
she will be 50′ north of Uranus; on the 13th, at 10:00 p. m.,
nearest the sun; and on the 14th, at 12:38 a. m., 2° 1′ north of
the moon.</p>

<h3>MARS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will be evening star during the entire month, and will afford
nothing of especial interest. He rises at 8:46, 8:41 and 8:35
a. m., on the 1st, 16th and 30th, respectively; and sets on the
same days at 6:06, 5:47 and 5:33 p. m., respectively. His
direct motion amounts to 24° 52′ 6″, and his diameter diminishes
two tenths of a second of arc. On the 19th, at 8:48 a. m.,
is 5° 26′ south of the moon.</p>

<h3>JUPITER,</h3>

<p class="unindent">On the other hand, grows in interest each day, his diameter
increasing from 33.2″ to 36″, and his countenance shedding
its light on an average of half the night during the month.
His motion is 2° 52′ 14″ direct. On the 11th, at 12:33 a. m.,
4° 26′ north of the moon; and on the 26th, at 3:00 a. m., 90°
west of the sun. He rises on the 1st at 12:53 a. m.; on the
16th, at 12:00, midnight; and on the 29th, at 11:11 p. m., and
is consequently a morning star.</p>

<h3>SATURN</h3>

<p class="unindent">Will be morning star, although visible nearly the entire night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and will increase in diameter from 18.8″ to 19.4″. Will have
a retrograde motion of 2° 8′ 38″, and on the 5th, at 10:18 p. m.,
will be 3° 23′ north of the moon. On the 1st, will rise at 7:25
p. m., and on the next morning set at 10:03 a. m.; on the 16th,
will rise at 6:22 p. m., and on the 17th, set at 9:00 a. m.; and
on the 30th, rise at 5:23 p. m., and set on December 1st, at
8:01 a. m.</p>

<h3>URANUS</h3>

<p class="unindent">Is also morning star, rising on the 1st at 3:20 a. m.; on the
16th, at 2:25 a. m.; and on the 30th, at 1:32 a. m., and setting
on the afternoon of the same days at 3:22, 2:25 and 1:30 p. m.,
in the same order. His motion is direct, and amounts to
1° 26′ 27″ of arc. Diameter increases one tenth of a second
of arc. On the 3d, at 6:00 a. m., is 50′ south of Venus; and
on the 13th, at 3:45 a. m., is 1° 54′ north of the moon.</p>

<h3>NEPTUNE.</h3>

<p>This distant neighbor of ours, in his far-away home, seems
to have exhausted his resources in his early efforts at disturbing
the motion of Uranus, and sinking to the common level,
now makes his accustomed rounds without attracting any
attention from the great mass of the world’s people, and but
little from astronomers themselves. But he is still among his
companions, and we find him claiming for himself this month
the distinction of both a morning and an evening star—the
former for the first half of the month, the latter for the remainder.
On the 1st, 16th and 30th, he rises at 5:35, 4:35 and
3:38 p. m., respectively, and sets on the mornings of the 2d,
17th, and December 1st, at 7:33, 6:31, and 5:34. On the 3d,
at 8:14 p. m., he is 1° 28′ north of the moon; and on the 13th,
at 3:00 p. m., 180° west of the sun; that is, in opposition.</p>

<h2 id="MELROSE_AND_HOLYROOD">MELROSE AND HOLYROOD.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY EDITH SESSIONS TUPPER.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>These two famous specimens of ruined Gothic architecture
have been written and sung by many historians and poets.
Scott says:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“If thou would’st view fair Melrose aright,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Go visit it by the pale moon light.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">But the ordinary commonplace tourist can not always plan his
trips by the almanac, and thus it was that we saw it not by moonlight,
when indeed it must be a scene of enchantment, but under
the broad sunlight of a glorious midsummer day. Though
several years have passed since then, there comes to me now
as in a dream, a perfect picture of the noble ruin, superb even
in its desolation and decay, with the greenest, softest grass for
its floor and the glorious canopy of a perfect summer sky for
its roof, the soft sunlight streaming athwart pillar and carved
window and the rich ivy clinging lovingly to its mouldering
sides. And ah! how the birds sang, its only music now.
And what must it have been with its roof, buttresses and pinnacles
entire, its gorgeous windows ablaze with color, with
chime of bells and solemn peal of organ resounding through
its naves and aisles—an object of reverence and admiration to
the brave, the good, the noble of the land of Wallace and
Bruce!</p>

<p>Melrose was founded in 1136 by David I. of Scotland, who
also founded the abbeys of Holyrood, Kelso and Dryburgh,
and was consecrated ten years later with all the pomp and
circumstance peculiar to the ecclesiasticism of those days. By
royal charter it was granted to the Cistercian order of monks,
which, previous to this, had been established in France. This
monastery was the mother church to all of this order in Scotland.
In the retreat from Scotland of Edward II., in 1322, the
English wreaked their fury on religious houses, and among
others destroyed Melrose.</p>

<p>To the end that the abbey might be rebuilt, King Robert
made a grant of £2,000 to the Abbot of Melrose. Had it not
been for this destruction we should have missed the exceeding
beauty of this famous ruin, for at the time the church was restored,
the Gothic style of architecture had attained its most
perfect development.</p>

<p>In 1384 Richard II. made an inroad to Scotland, lodged one
night in the abbey and set fire to it in the morning. Afterward
he made grants to the church, which meant, let us hope,
that his majesty repented his act of vandalism.</p>

<p>Again was the monastery destroyed in 1545 by the Earl of
Hertford. Tradition has it that the English on their return at
that time had passed the abbeys of Melrose and Dryburgh
when the bells were rung to express the joy of the monks at
their escape; on hearing the sound, the English were not slow
to return and turn their joy into sorrow.</p>

<p>Soon after the Scottish reformation took place and the abbey
was never again rebuilt. After the reformation, one James
Douglass, commendator, took down a good share of the ruin
to build a house. His example was quickly followed by
others, and for some time the people of Melrose used the venerable
ruins for a quarry, and it is said there is not an old
house in Melrose but has a stone from the abbey in its walls.
Since it passed into the hands of his grace, the Duke of Buccleuch,
every precaution has been taken to prevent its further
decay. The rules of the Cistercians were very rigid, and for
many years were strictly enforced. But there came a time
when wealth flowed freely into the monastery, when royalty
and nobility vied with each other in heaping costly gifts upon
it, when the brothers waxed fat and loved their flesh-pots and
goodly libations, and holy living was neglected and the name
of the monks of Melrose came to be a hissing and a by-word.</p>

<p>Melrose, like all the other abbeys of olden time stands east
and west. Nothing of the original structure remains save the
side chapels on the south aisle, the first three of which are
roofless. These chapels have been used as burying places for
families of note in the vicinity. In one is a carved representation
of the heads of David I. and his queen Matilda. In another
is an ancient kneeling-stone facing toward the sunset,
four horseshoes on its back and this inscription on its top:
“<i>Orate pro anima fratris Petre, ærari?</i>” Pray for the soul of
brother Peter, the treasurer.</p>

<p>The charm of the south transcript, lies chiefly in the wonderful
carving and the graceful proportions of the various parts
which form so symmetrical and perfect a whole. Perhaps the
most exquisite specimen of carving is on the capital of a pillar
which bounds the south aisle on the east, separating it from
the nave; it represents the Scotch kale and is a most delicate
piece of point lace carving. From the south transept also one
can best see the small high window in the wall of the north
transept, the tracery of which is quite perfect, and is said to
represent the crown of thorns. In this part of the abbey are
some curious and quaint inscriptions, one of which reads:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Sa gaes ye compass even about,</div>
<div class="verse i1">Sa truth and laute do but doute.</div>
<div class="verse i1">Behalde to ye hande of John Muroo.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="unindent">Another inscription a little higher up tells who this John
Morrow was, and his connection with the abbey:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“John : Morow : sum : tyme : callit :</div>
<div class="verse i1">Was : I : and : born : in : Parysse :</div>
<div class="verse i1">Certainly : and : had : in : kepping :</div>
<div class="verse i1">All : mason : work : of : Sautau :</div>
<div class="verse i1">Druys : ye : hye : kyrk : of : Glasgu :</div>

<div class="verse i1">Nyddysdale : and : of : Galway :</div>
<div class="verse i1">I : pray : to : God : and : Mary : bath :</div>
<div class="verse i1">And : sweet : St. : John : keep : this : holy :</div>
<div class="verse i5">Kirk : frae : skath :”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">He is said to have been the first Grand Master of the Freemason
lodge of Melrose.</p>

<p>Just east of this transept is St. Bridget’s chapel, where is still
to be seen a statue of that saint beside one of the windows.
In a corner between this chapel and the chancel is according
to the “Lay of the Last Minstrel,” the grave of the wizard
Michael Scott.</p>

<p>Just beyond this grave is a flat stone which was the favorite
resting place of that other wizard, Sir Walter Scott, when he
came here to feast on the mournful beauty of the scene. To
the magic influence of this noble ruin we may be indebted for
many of the beautiful thoughts he has given us. Doubtless
that wonderful imagination of his peopled those silent chapels
and dim shadowy aisles with a host of illustrious dead. In
speechless dignity and beauty they passed in review before
him, a glorious company of the departed whose names, brightened
by his magic touch, will live forever. But the chief place
of interest is the chancel, under whose floor lie the ashes of
those long, long dead. Alexander II. and Waldevus, the
second Abbot of Melrose, a man of holy life, much loved for
his exceeding gentleness, lie here.</p>

<p>The “Flower of Chivalry,” the famous Black Douglas, who
was killed by his kinsman while hunting in Ettrick Forest, was
buried here. Another Douglas, James the Earl, killed by
Harry Hotspur, was here buried with the greatest pomp and
ceremony.</p>

<p>But the most precious deposit, and the one for which these
magnificent ruins seem a fitting tomb, is that right royal heart
which once beat high with truth, valor and bravery, but which
“feels its pulse no more,” the heart of “King Robert the
Bruce.” It was the wish of the king that his heart should be
buried in this abbey. However, subsequent to that, he expressed
a desire that it should rather be interred in the Holy
Sepulchre in Palestine. To this end Sir James Douglas set
sail with the precious burden, but in Spain encountered the
Saracens. Bravely refusing to retreat he fought and fell, but
the king’s heart was saved, brought back to his nation’s land,
and after such fitful fever was laid to rest at last in fair Melrose.
The chancel is lighted by three superb windows, the
one to the east being the one of which Scott wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The moon on the east oriel shone</div>
<div class="verse i1">Through slender shafts of shapely stone;</div>
<div class="verse i1">By foliaged tracery combined;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Thou would’st have thought some fairy’s hand</div>
<div class="verse i1">’Twixt poplars straight the osier wand</div>
<div class="verse i1">In many a freakish knot had twined;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Then framed a spell, when the work was done,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And changed the willow wreaths to stone.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>High on the west wall of the north transept can be seen the
statues of St. Peter with his book and keys and St. Paul with a
sword. When we saw them they were in an excellent state of
preservation. In the north wall of the north transept are two
doors with rounded arches; the first led into the sacristy or
wax cellar, where the tapers and the communion wine were
kept; the other it is supposed led to the treasury.</p>

<p>The carving in the north aisle is almost as worthy of admiration
as that of the south aisle, being quite fresh and wonderfully
beautiful. An ancient inscription here catches the eye:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Heir lys the race</div>
<div class="verse i1">Of ye hoos of Leir.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cloisters also show much fine carving. In the true
Gothic, nature alone was imitated, which accounts for the endless
variety of design. At the top of the east wall of the cloisters
is an excellent representation of a negro’s grinning face;
at the corner is seen the figure of a flying angel. The roof is
quite gone, as are the pillars which supported it. The beholder
realizes the ruin and decay more here than in any other portion
of the abbey. The ornamentation of the central tower
can best be seen from the cloisters. There is a legend that
Cromwell once turned his cannon upon the abbey from Gattonside
heights, and marks on the north wall are shown to carry
out the tale.</p>

<p>Grand as is the interior, the visitor is more impressed by the
massive yet graceful exterior, with its pinnacles, flying buttresses
and its exquisite pillars and windows. The zealous
Scottish reformers pulled down nearly all the statues, only two
remaining, those of the Virgin and child, and of St. Andrew.</p>

<p>A famous and grotesque gargoyle, a pig playing upon bagpipes,
projects from the roof in a noticeable manner.</p>

<p>West of the south entrance is a pedestal supported by the
figure of a monk holding a scroll, on which is inscribed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Cu : Venit : Tes : Jeg : Cessabit : Umbra.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">(When Jesus came the darkness of the world ceased.)</p>

<p>On the opposite side of the doorway is another inscription
held by the figure of an aged monk:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Passens : c : q : ipse : voluit.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">(He suffered because he himself willed it.)</p>

<p>Over the doorway is a half length figure of John the Beloved,
with this inscription in Latin:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Behold the Lamb of God.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But it is impossible to enumerate all of the interesting carvings,
heads, figures and inscriptions. The picture of the
magnificent ruin with its delightful accessories, the songs of
birds, the soft, genial summer air, the peaceful sky, the half
pleasant, half mournful recollections which it arouses, fades
from memory, and in its stead rises the semblance of another
venerable pile, half abbey, half palace, lying at the foot of
lofty crags—the world famous Holyrood.</p>

<p>The story of the founding of Holyrood or Holy Rude is told
by ancient chroniclers as follows: The munificent and good
King David I. was not absolutely faultless. He was minded
to hunt on a holy day, the festival of the exaltation of the cross
or Rude day as it was called, in spite of the admonitions of
his confessor. Heated with the chase the king had ridden to
the “fute of the crag,” when there rushed suddenly upon him
the “farest hart that ever was sene,” and threw both him and
his horse with violence to the ground. The king threw back
his hands between the antlers of the stag to save himself from
the blow, when suddenly “the haly croce slaid into his
hands.” The stag fled in dismay at sight of the sacred emblem,
and the king resolved to found a house to the “Holy
Rude,” the Virgin, and all saints on the spot where “he gat
the croce.”</p>

<p>This legend, however, is not generally credited, there being
a more satisfactory reason given by other chroniclers for the
founding of the abbey. Margaret, the grand niece of Edward
the Confessor, and mother of King David, gave to her son a
cross of pure gold, which opened and shut like a casket, and
which contained, it was claimed, a portion of that cross on
which Christ died. It might be reasonable to believe that the
king built the abbey as a receptacle for this sacred relic, as he
bestowed it upon this religious house. This emblem was
called “the black rude,” and was for ages regarded as the
palladium of the kings of Scotland. It was at last captured
from David II. at the battle of Neville’s Cross, and for centuries
after was kept in the Cathedral of Durham. But it matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
not whether built to form a fitting shrine for the holy relic
or to commemorate the king’s narrow escape from death by the
interposition of the “Holy Rude,” the noble pile has not been
spared by time’s ruthless hand, and only the chapel royal remains
of that great monastery, the choir and transepts being
entirely gone, and the sole remaining portion even being
roofless.</p>

<p>But the crumbling, ivy grown walls have wonderful associations
connected with them. The crown of Scotland has here
been placed upon many royal brows; here James II. was
married to Mary of Gueldres, and James III. to Margaret of
Denmark; here James IV. was presented by the legate of his
holiness, Pope Julius II., with that sword and crown which are
yet preserved among the regalia of Scotland; and here,
strangest scene of all its eventful history, under the great eastern
window, in an evil moment, the beautiful White Rose of
Scotland was married to the profligate Darnley. We are told
that this abbey was the last resting place of many great ones,
but when the transepts and choir were destroyed the ancient
memorials were lost. It is said that David II., James II. and
James V. were buried here, but of the tomb of David not a
vestige remains, and there is much doubt as to the exact
locality of the tombs of the others.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the abbey is the western front,
consisting of a great square tower, and an immense gateway
with two curious windows above it. This tower is a superb
specimen of the architecture of the period of transition from
the Romanesque to the Early English. Above the doorway
and between the windows is a tablet placed there by Charles

<p>But interesting as is this ancient abbey, the palace is of more
attraction to visitors. Ill-fated James IV. founded it, and it
was no sooner completed than he brought his bride to live
therein. They were married and she was crowned in the
chapel royal. Here also came the fair French princess Magdalene,
first queen of James V., received with every indication
of joy and affection, blooming in youth and beauty, only to be
laid in the earth forty days after her arrival. The second
queen of James and mother of Mary Stuart, Mary of Guise,
was also crowned in the chapel. But of the multitude of
famous women who have swept in the glory of their pride and
beauty through the halls of this palace, the most thrilling interest
clusters round the name of the ill-starred Mary Stuart.
Here occurred those events which will forever link the name
of Holyrood with that of the unfortunate “White Queen.”</p>

<p>To Holyrood she came first after her arrival from “her
pleasant land of France” she loved so much; here she married
the inferior and dissolute Darnley, and her Rizzio was
foully murdered before her eyes; in the council chamber of
the palace she married “Black Bothwell,” and her last night
before being sent a captive to Lochleven was spent within
these walls.</p>

<p>That part of the palace built by Charles II. is of quadrangular
shape, having a court in the center. It was while passing
through this court that we met a pompous, overdressed
woman who was saying in a loud voice to her companion,
“Well, what of it? What if Mary Stuart did live here? What
does that amount to?”</p>

<p>The great picture gallery is in this part of the palace. It is
one hundred and fifty feet in length and is hung round with
portraits of a hundred Scotch kings. This room is of historical
interest, for “Bonnie Prince Charlie” used it for a ball room,
while he was staying at Holyrood. Readers of “Waverley”
will remember the description in that book of the great ball
given in this room. From this vast room the visitor may enter
Lord Darnley’s apartments, which are soon scanned, for one
is more eager to see Queen Mary’s room. At last we mount
a gloomy stairway and enter what is perhaps the most famous
and sadly interesting suite of rooms in all Europe.</p>

<p>The queen’s audience chamber is a large room lighted by
two windows. The walls are draped with faded and time-worn
tapestry. Here stands the bed upon which two other unfortunate
Stuarts laid their uneasy heads, Charles I. and the Pretender,
and after “Culloden’s bloody field, dark source o’
mony a tear” the conqueror of the latter, the Duke of Cumberland,
slept upon the same pillow. It was in this room that
Mary had those stormy scenes with Knox, the Scottish reformer.</p>

<p>In the bedroom still stand her chairs, her bed with its faded
hangings, and the basket which Elizabeth sent her filled with
baby linen. There is also a bit of her embroidery, carefully
preserved in a glass case. On the walls hang the sadly tarnished
mirror which has so often reflected her lovely face, her
portrait and those of Henry VIII. and Elizabeth, given her by
the Virgin Queen, “her sister and her foe.”</p>

<p>Poor, unhappy queen! How she must have pined for her
sunny France, among those cold, northern people. How often
has she stood at these very windows and turned her beautiful
eyes, filled with tears, toward those great mountains which shut
her in. Whatever she was, good or vile, an abused, suffering
woman, or an unprincipled, intriguing queen, we can think of
her only with pity. But the most famous room is that little
chamber, no larger than a good sized closet, where Rizzio was
so cruelly murdered. Into this little room rushed the conspirators,
overturning the table and putting out the lights, dragging
their victim from Mary’s feet out through her bedroom,
audience chamber, and into the hall beyond, stabbing him at
every step and leaving him at last with fifty-six wounds in his
body. And to this room the brutal Ruthven returned and
demanded a cup of wine, and in the frightened queen’s presence
tossed it off with wine red hand. Could it have been
imagination only that loaded the air of that dark, damp, silent
palace with heavy sighs? that caused one to look behind, at
sound of footsteps and the sweeping of robes? that peopled
those empty rooms with tenants of air, troubled ghosts of the
illustrious dead?</p>

<p>Each old ruin has a charm all its own. Under these ivy-grown
battlements how many fair women and brave men have
lived, eaten, drunken, danced, sorrowed, loved and died;
within these gray old walls what heartaches, ambitions, loves
and hates have been nurtured, all to end at last and leave only
silence and decay.</p>

<p>We left the palace and went out into the glad sunlight, to
the green fields, to the flowers, to life; leaving behind desolation,
death. Slowly we turned back to the city, and the last
thing we heard was the mournful song of the birds which were
flying about the ruins.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>The rich man, indeed, is better able to indulge his passions,
and to bear up against any harm that may befall him. The poor
man’s condition prevents him from enjoying such advantages;
but then, as a set-off, he may possess strength of body, freedom
from disease, a mind relieved from many of the ills of life, is
blessed in his children, and active in his limbs. If he shall,
besides, end his life well, then, O Crœsus, this is the happy man,
about whom thou art curiously inquiring. Call no man happy
till thou knowest the end of his life; up till that moment he can
only be called fortunate.—<i>Herodotus.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“God’s prophets of the Beautiful these poets are.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For three centuries England has luxuriated in a succession
of regal poets, wearing, not hereditary crowns, but laurel
wreaths bestowed by royal hands in virtue of the loyalty rather
than the melody of their stanzas. Two centuries earlier Edward
III. indulged Chaucer, the “Father of English Poetry,”
in his harmless aspiration to enjoy the title of laureate, and
the honor skipped along with irregular movement until Queen
Elizabeth wreathed the brow of Spenser in laurel, giving the
position such dignity that succeeding monarchs considered it
an indispensable luxury to have a rhymer in the royal household
to honor the birthday of king and queen, princes and
princesses with an ode, graceful, polished, fervent.</p>

<p>The idea of poet laureate is not of English birth, but comes
with other literary sentiments from Grecian days, the custom
being to enliven the great musical contests by publicly crowning
the successful poet. Rome in the days of the empire
adopted the custom, adding to the formality and grace of the
occasion. Germany revived the long neglected courtesy in the
twelfth century, and was the <i>first to christen the crowned bard</i>
“<i>Laureate</i>.”</p>

<p>The French had special poets for the rhythmic praises of the
imperial household, but from prejudice or neglect did not
adopt the German title, while the Spaniards had both the poets
and the title, but lacked the favor of the goddess of song.
The Saxons, from their earliest days, were lovers of music,
though content with a low order of song. For centuries the
minstrels were the favorites with the unalloyed Saxon race.
Not until the eleventh century, when William the Conqueror
grafted the Norman blood into the sturdy Saxon veins, was
there call for a higher order of song than the minstrel furnished.
As the two nations intermingled their habits and social
customs, as the languages blended the strength of the one with
the grace of the other for three centuries, the people were prepared
in mind and heart, in thought and sentiment, to appreciate
a national poet, and after nine centuries without a poet or
a language out of which poetry could be woven, they found
themselves suddenly possessed with a poet of highest order
and a language melodious in its every accent.</p>

<p>The splendor of chivalry had reached its height, and the
magnificent court of Edward III. brought to a climax the
progressive spirit of the Plantagenets, and the series of victories
that initiated his reign exalted the pride of the nation and
brought it to a degree of patriotic order that must voice itself
in a national poet. For such an hour was Geoffrey Chaucer
sent, a poetic genius, whose birth and associations calculated
to make the art in his hands chivalric.</p>

<p>His name—Chaussier—of Norman birth, anglicised itself
gracefully into Chaucer, indicative of the ease with which, reciprocally,
he translated the legends of Saxon life in a new
language, the poetic.</p>

<p>Born in London, possibly educated at Cambridge, probably
a child of wealth, a page in the service of a noble lady, a soldier
of the king, a prisoner in French hands, and ransomed
by his king, all before he was twenty, it is easy to see that he
ingratiated himself early into a variety of experiences from
which a poet can profitably draw. In his young manhood,
following the adventures of youth, he was in the service of the
king as valet of the chamber. He served as comptroller of
customs, and negotiated delicate personal matters for the king
at home and in foreign courts, was employed on important embassies
open and secret, even negotiating for the marriage of
the Prince of Wales in France.</p>

<p>Upon one of these foreign missions he witnessed tourneys,
grand receptions and magnificent displays, of such a character
that he was possessed with a desire to see his own country follow
suit, and as an initiative step aspired at being himself
crowned poet laureate to the king, in which he was humored by
Edward III., who allowed him also £100 as an annual allowance.
The succeeding king, Richard II., the last of the
Plantagenets, confirmed him in the position and secured to
him its financial reward.</p>

<p>This first laureate purples the horizon of English literature,
but so faint is the flush of dawn that it is impossible to fix the
year of his birth, which may have been as early as 1328, and
may have been as late as 1345. To understand the circumstances
under which he wrote we must consider the England
in which he lived, and for which he wrote. It was no more
thickly settled than the state of Vermont, the entire population
being only about the same as that of Missouri. The city of
London then had no more than Lynn, Portland, Omaha, or
Somerville—35,000. It had been larger, but had suffered from
the great plagues. But this must not mislead us, for, notwithstanding
her diminutive size, England was the most powerful
nation of western Europe, and three nations of historic prominence
were suppliants for her favor. The nation was wealthy,
and the middle classes appreciated and demanded increased
financial, political and social privileges. It was this first hope
and purpose of the people that ripened the nation for its
poet.</p>

<p>Cæsar set foot on British soil fourteen centuries earlier; the
Saxons made permanent abode nine centuries before his day;
Alfred the Great glorified the Saxon Heptarchy five centuries
before the poet sang; and what wonder that he who created
the very language that could be poetic should aspire for the
first laurel wreath?</p>

<p>For nearly a thousand years there had been no poetry in the
Saxon life, there had never been on British soil. Beauty and
harmony were missing in their speech and deeds. The history
they had made was devoid of sentiment, hence the almost universal
disinclination to read the history of those years. As
soon as there was sentiment in their life it was poetized.</p>

<p>Chaucer was merely a beautifier of thought. He originated
little, he glorified whatever he voiced. He breathed life into
the <i>thought</i> and <i>language</i> of the people, making them living
souls, the Adam and Eve of English life. It is too much
to ask that the primal poet who has to create language,
create thought also. He did for the language of England what
no other man was ever privileged to do for any nation. He
took the chaotic speech and gave it beauty and rhythmic symmetry.
He took foreign thought and made a home dress in
which to clothe it. He took a language that foreigners despised,
and of which the countrymen were ashamed, and
christened it into the triune of strength, beauty and melody, so
that it promises to be the universal tongue. He made a language
that has the elements of perpetual youth, such as is possessed
by no words but the Saxon’s.</p>

<p>In speaking of Chaucer as the initial laureate, it is with full
knowledge that a century earlier, before there was a poet worthy
the name, Henry III., of Magna Charta fame, had a
“Versificator Regis,” whom he allowed £100 per year, but
since it is impossible to find his name, or a line he ever wrote,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
it has not seemed wise to discount the honor so justly due him
who wrote the first classic English verse.</p>

<p>After Chaucer there was no inheritor of his wreath for nearly
a century, when, in the reign of Edward IV., who died 1485,
John Kay was laureate, but he left no verse to show whether
or not he adorned his position.</p>

<p>The growth of the custom into dignity and permanence was
through the universities. Each of the large classic institutions
had the established degree of poet laureate bestowed upon
those who graduated with honors from the courses in grammar,
rhetoric and versification. It was a requisite for all graduates
who presented themselves for this honorable degree, to write
a hundred creditable Latin verses on the glory of the university—though
sometimes another subject was assigned. Upon
graduation, and the acceptance of the Latin verses, he was
publicly crowned with a wreath of laurel, and styled “poeta
laureatus.” If he was ever selected by the king to rhyme his
praise he might style himself the “king’s humble poet laureate.”</p>

<p>John Skelton is the first whom we know to have taken all
these honors. He was a graduate of Cambridge in 1484, and
nine years later was wreathed poet laureate of Oxford, and soon
after of Lauvain, and in 1504, twenty years from graduation,
Cambridge gave him the same honorary title and wreath. He
also won the regal versifier’s crown, writing a poem when
Henry VII.’s eldest son, Prince Arthur, was created Prince
of Wales, and Latin verses when the infant Prince Henry
(VIII.) was created Duke of York in 1494. Skelton is spoken
of by his contemporaries as a special light and ornament to
British literature.</p>

<p>Bernard André, of whom nothing is known except that he was
a tutor of Prince Arthur, was poet laureate.</p>

<p>It was left to popular Queen Bess, among the many good
things of her fickle reign, to establish the rank of regal laureate
by conferring the laurel upon Edmund Spenser, since whom
there has been no vacancy except when Cromwell took the
poetry out of high life in England. Her reign is justly famed
for its abundance of literary, poetic and dramatic talent. It
was then that for the first time “Men of Letters” were a prominent
feature in national life, and in that galaxy of artists the
most brilliant star was her poet laureate.</p>

<p>Edmund Spenser was a charity boy, struggling for all his
opportunities, supported at school by a benevolent Londoner,
Robert Newell, but despite circumstances he was head boy.
While a grammar school boy his benefactor died, and in the
list of funeral expenses, still extant, is an item of two yards of
cloth given Edmund Spenser to make a gown, that he might
attend the funeral. This was the boyhood of the author of the
“Faerie Queen.” There were multitudes in England whose
parents, rolling in wealth, urged their children to study, but it
was left for a charity student to lead his age and rank as one
of the five great poets of the English tongue.</p>

<p>Pope Pius V. attempted to bring recreant England under
the sway of the Church of Rome, and issued a bull of deposition
against Elizabeth, attempting to enforce it by rebellion in
the counties of the north. But he underestimated the grit
and popularity of the queen, in whose interest the nation rose
as one man. It was in the fervor of this patriotic ardor that
Spenser published his first poems, awaking a sense of expectancy
in the public mind, which he gratified later with his
matchless glorification of Queen Bess in the “Faerie Queen.”</p>

<p>In the Elizabethan days even a poet of Spenser’s genius, whom
the nation ardently admired, could not hope to live by poetic
writing. In our own day Longfellow received from a weekly
paper $4,000, or $20 a line, for his “Hanging of the Crane,”
but Spenser’s pen could not have produced poems fast enough
to have guaranteed him a living. Substantial favors from the
royal court were indispensable unless he turned his mind and
hand to other employments. Queen Elizabeth made it her
established policy to encourage literature by special bequests,
and Sir Philip Sidney, her confidential counselor, proposed an
award to Spenser’s loyalty and genius, and she instructed
Lord Cecil of the treasury to give him £100, but he remonstrated
that it was too much for such indulgence as poetry,
whereupon she permitted him to give what was reasonable,
and consequently he gave nothing which measured his value
of verse. Spenser’s need was so great that he was forced to
remind the queen of her neglect, which he did in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“I was promised on a time,</div>
<div class="verse i1">To have reason for my rhyme;</div>
<div class="verse i1">From that time unto this season</div>
<div class="verse i1">I received nor rhyme nor reason.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">This spicy reminder brought him his £100, and Lord Cecil
a sharp expression of her dissatisfaction. He was eventually
given an estate—Kilcolman Castle—of three thousand acres,
in Ireland. He was also laureated, with a pension of £50.
When circumstances at last favored his enjoyment of peace,
that had been denied him from childhood, he fell on evil
times. Tyrone, a bold and crafty Irish chieftain, rose in rebellion,
attacking Kilcolman Castle so unexpectedly that the
poet and his wife barely escaped with their lives, after their
infant child had perished in the cruel flames. He was now
forty-six years of age, and a grief-stricken, broken-hearted
mourner for his castle, library and babe, he went to London in
poverty, and before his friends realized that he was in the
metropolis, this great bard, Queen Bess’s laureate, died of starvation,
in a rude, comfortless room, on a cold day, without a
friend to minister to his necessities. After death, honors innumerable
were paid to his memory.</p>

<p>Thus lived and died the first who wore the laurel in the royal
household of that long line that has graced the court circle for
three hundred years. Of the poets who have worn the wreath
in sunshine and shadow under the Tudors, Stuarts and Brunswicks,
a second article will treat.</p>

<h2 id="COMMON_SENSE_IN_THE_AMERICAN_KITCHEN">COMMON SENSE IN THE AMERICAN KITCHEN.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY LAURA LORAINE.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>The great middle class of American society to which, perhaps,
most of us belong, contains an unsolved element, a
puzzling factor, a something for which, so far, we have found
no satisfactory niche. We have more girls than we know
what to do with. In every town we find them bright, loving,
energetic, ambitious, but sphereless. They are not needed at
home, and there are no husbands available, for whom they can
make homes; their needs are many and the parental purse is
half empty; their energies are boundless, and they have no
channel in which to turn them. What can they do? It is a
sorely perplexing question. They might copy, but the business
men of all the towns from the lakes to the Gulf will tell
you there are twenty copyists for every position; they might
teach, but school teachers overrun every community; there
are more seamstresses than seams; more clerks than counters,
more bookkeepers than desks.</p>

<p>A bright, stylish, well informed and popular girl lately applied
at the office of a friend of mine, asking for “anything at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
all. I’ll make the fires, sweep the floors, run errands, do any
kind of work to earn a little money. I have tried everywhere,
but there are no positions of any kind vacant.”</p>

<p>Another young girl, an excellent musician, inquiring for
work, said: “I have been given an ordinary musical education,
but I can’t use it here. No one needs a music teacher
or organist of my medium ability. If I had $2,000 to fit myself
to be a superior teacher there would be no trouble about
a position; but see there,” pointing to a shabby glove, “that
is absolutely my best pair of gloves, and one <i>must</i> have
clothes.” But these are common remarks, painfully common.</p>

<p>A gentleman who employs a large number of girls, remarked
in my hearing recently: “One of my hardest trials
is to listen to the pathetic stories of girls who come to me for
work. Many of them are from good families, often moving in
my own circle. They need something to do, and the positions
which they are fitted to fill are overflowing. I can not
give them work, and to refuse them seems cruel. There ought
to be some way for such girls.”</p>

<p>But there is in this same class of society a second problem equally
puzzling—the troublesome kitchen question, which haunts
so many of those women who manage their own households and
employ girls for “general housework.” They find it almost
impossible to fill these positions with the proper kind of help.
For such work they need willing, strong, reliable, lady-like
girls; girls who will appreciate the importance of the domestic
machinery, and who will be able not only to keep up the fire,
but keep the cogs all greased and smoothly running. They
need those who will take pleasure in the beauty of the home
and the health of the family, who will be, in short, helpmates
and supports to them, burdened as they are with
social duties, care of children, and the sometimes unfathomable
question of making the two ends meet. They need such
helpers, but alas, not one in a thousand possesses such. There
is one way to satisfy the want. It is to make the plus of our first
problem satisfy the minus of the second. To so adjust matters
that the thousands of girls waiting for work or dying under
the strain of their poorly paid sewing, or of their weary
days on their feet at the counter may take up the general
housework in the thousands of homes where they are needed.</p>

<p>By many, such a solution is declared “out of the question.”
The girls themselves flatly settle it by declaring they’ll starve
first; the housekeepers give it little encouragement. It is
generally conceded that it might be a good thing, but that “it
is not practical.” But why not practical? Why is starvation
preferable? Why can not the housekeepers adopt the plan?
What objections are to be urged against such work by the
girls themselves? They can earn more—we have no hesitation
in saying that, for look at the figures in the case. Let us suppose
that a girl has obtained a position as a copyist or clerk;
she will receive $1.00 per day in our average towns—not more;
and in nearly all cases absence, whether from sickness,
trouble or a holiday, will be deducted; however, as employers
differ in this particular, let us suppose that she have regular
work, her yearly receipts will be in a year of 365 days, deducting
fifty-two Sabbaths, $313. Of this, $4.00 per week at least
will be spent for board, fire, lights and washing; she has a
balance of $105. Put her in the school room at the ordinary
salary of the primary teacher, $400, she will have a balance of
$192, if her board be rated as above at $4.00 per week. Now
this same girl in the kitchen doing general housework would
have no difficulty in securing $3.00 per week. Her cash balance
at the end of the year would be her entire wages, $156;
$51 more than the girl at the counter, $36 less than the school
teacher, but think of the difference in the expenses of the last
two. A girl doing general housework needs no work dress
the year round save calico. In this she will be becomingly
and appropriately dressed. A teacher must, a large part of
the year, dress in wool, a goods at least five times as expensive.
She has a large item for the wear and tear of wraps, hats,
gloves, and rubbers, and another for stationery and books. It
is not unfair to say that an economical and industrious girl
earning $3.00 per week at housework can more easily lay up
$50 in a year and dress better on the street and for church
than the school teacher on $400 per year. It is not a question
of money. There is, if anything, a cash balance in favor of
the housework.</p>

<p>Is it then the work which makes such places so undesirable?
Housework is undeniably hard. There is much of what we
call drudgery about it. There is scrubbing, and washing and
ironing, but the drudgery of housework does not last the week
through. There is but one washday in a week. Done faithfully
and with spirit, it leaves in ordinary households a frequent
hour for sewing or chatting, one or two afternoons of
each week, and almost invariably every evening. More
leisure, we honestly believe, than either a clerk, seamstress or
teacher finds. It is healthy. Compare the effects upon the
constitution, of housework and of those employments which
keep the worker sitting or standing most of the day. Go
over your list of acquaintances in kitchens, school rooms, shops,
and at desks, and you will find that though the housework may
make grimy hands, it leaves the spring in the step, that though
it may tire the body it does not stretch the nerves, that it is
followed by a good appetite and sound sleep, where too often
the other pursuits exhaust the nerves, depress the spirits, and
wear out the girls.</p>

<p>And it is certainly respectable work. Were the kitchen of a
duchess vacant her ladyship would only be honored if she
bravely broiled her own steak and washed up her dishes.</p>

<p>No one will say the work degrades. But though it is
honorable, healthy, and pays, yet strangely enough the girl
feels that she can not be anybody if she undertake it, and the
world believes she has forfeited her position when she does.
Strange anomaly, that what is respectable in the mistress of
the house should unfit her maid for social standing. Yet
there are reasons for it, and one weighty reason is the popular
opinion of housework—the feeling that it is belittling drudgery,
that it requires simply muscles and no brains, that it unfits a
woman for intellectual pursuits and for the finer accomplishments.
If this be true, then girls are wise to shrink from such
work, for mere drudgery is of all things the most benumbing
to one’s facility, and can not but degrade one in the end. But
this is not true. Housework is a profession. Cooking is a fine
art. Upon the skill and wisdom with which the daily work of
a home is done depends the comfort, health and happiness
largely of a family. The woman who manages your kitchen
has it in her power to make perpetual discord in your home
if she has not brains to manage your work; she can ruin your
digestion if she does not understand the preparation of food
and its effects in the human system; she can make a barn of
your rooms if she has not artistic taste. The idea that the
person who is to cook and serve your meals need have only
big muscles and stout hands is totally false; she must be
educated to her profession, must respect it and take pleasure
in it, if she is to be a success.</p>

<p>Gradually the importance of household arts is becoming
evident to the best educated women. The home and its duties
have become subjects for serious study of late years, and to-day
there is hardly a topic on which so much is being written.
Schools of cookery are becoming prominent features of our
larger cities. They are patronized by our first ladies. Their
teachers receive salaries equal to the best of our high school
teachers and are everywhere received as ladies. Neither
going to a cooking school nor teaching in a cooking school unfits
woman for society; yet she does the same kind of work there
as she would in a kitchen. The difference is just here: The
cooking school pupil mixes her bread with brains and salts
her potatoes with wits, and the brains and wits make a profession
of what we have been pleased heretofore to call drudgery.
It is the lack of this seasoning that has outlawed kitchen work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
It is not the bread and potatoes. Why should we not have
girls who are superior housekeepers, who are known as rising
young cooks? Why should not ambition and skill be respected
and rewarded in this profession as well as in any other?
No reason, certainly, but the poor one that the girls have not
been able to feel yet, that cooking and housework are really
important; that though housekeepers have begun to study the
subjects, the ideas are yet in the abstract and have not yet
reached the kitchen. It is, however, we may be sure, but a
question of time. Housework will be honored as it deserves,
and the girls who undertake this labor will feel that they are
doing as elevating and as intellectual work, certainly, as they
would do at the counter, copying desk or sewing table.</p>

<p>But however much girls may respect housework, and however
thoroughly they may prepare for it, our problems can
never be solved by them alone. The kitchen millennium is
largely in the hands of the housekeeper. There must be a
radical change in her opinion of the position, and in her treatment
of her help. When reform in the treatment of help is
suggested, a woman usually asks: “Do you mean that I ought
to make my girl one of my family? that she should sit at my
table?” The ordinary opinion is that this is the pivotal point
in the discussion, and that in order to reform, the mistress
must make a friend of her maid. It seems to me that this is a
great mistake, and does not touch the vital point at all. It
touches a social relation; while the relation between mistress
and maid is purely a business one. A girl enters a house to do
certain duties, not to be a part of the family. She does her
work, to be sure, within the dwelling, but because she works
there is no more a reason why she should become a companion
than there is reason for the clerk, bookkeeper, tailor or
dress-maker of the family becoming a companion. Not that she
is not so good—she is often better; not that she is less a lady—she
is often more—but simply because her relations with
the housekeeper are business relations, and in the family circle
it is very undesirable that these duties should be obtruded.
To make her a part of the family and one of your friends, her
whole social life must be changed. She has different views,
different surroundings, different friends, from the lady of the
house. Either the two different sets must be amalgamated in
order that a social relation may exist, or mistress or maid
must one of them give up her friends. A ridiculous idea, and
one as undesirable to the one as to the other. The girl has no
idea of being companion to the lady; when she complains of
not being invited into the parlor, and to the table, it is generally
because she feels that in some way, still does not understand
exactly how, she is not respected as she deserves to be.</p>

<p>But, some one says, supposing the girl be one of our own set
or from among our friends, what then? I have seen daughters
in certain families doing the work, and I never saw any trouble
about adjustment of relations. If the girl be your friend,
then treat her as your friend, of course, and take her into the
“inner courts.” But, as would generally be the case, if she
be a stranger the relation is purely a business one, and what
you owe to any one with whom you do business you owe her.
But you do not owe it to her to make her a part of your family
circle unless both you and she wish it.</p>

<p>It is a disagreeable fact that very many well bred
women practice a system of “bossism” in their kitchens.
They look upon their help as a necessary evil, a human machine,
which by daily orders and scoldings they are to keep in
running order. A vital mistake, for the girl who does your
work is and ought to be regarded as holding an important position
in your domestic economy. She is doing as honorable
and necessary work in carrying out your directions as you in
giving them. She sustains a relation as much to be respected
as does a confidential clerk to your husband. Now, on this
ground you owe her unfailing courtesy—a pleasant good morning,
such as any well bred person will give to every one they
meet, and kindly appreciation of her work and wants. This
courtesy is oftenest wanting in giving directions. If she is to
do the work, then it is due her that you plan with her, that you
together talk over things. If her plans are better than yours,
acknowledge it and give her her share of praise. If possible,
inspire her with the feeling that this is “our” work, not merely
“my work” that she is doing. When personal interest is inspired,
almost invariably a home-like air will spring up in the
kitchen. The girl who presides loses that belittling, humiliating
feeling that she is only a drudge, and grows to know her real
importance, to respect herself and her business, while the
woman at the helm grows light hearted as she recognizes what
a stanch, reliable support she has in this department of her
home. Working together is the only successful plan for employer
and <i>employé</i>.</p>

<p>Another just cause of complaint is the too common practice
of making a girl extra work. She deserves consideration in
this respect. If the breakfast hour is at eight o’clock, it is a
breach of etiquette on the part of the family to stretch it out
until nine. The duties of the day demand that certain work
of the kitchen be done at certain times. “A woman’s work is
never done” is in some households accepted as a natural law.
No one hesitates to ask an extra service of the kitchen girl, or
to interrupt her labors. No one thinks to apologize if they
hinder her regular work, or to even give a reason for asking a
troublesome service at a busy time in the day. Is it strange
that girls refuse to undertake kitchen work, when they know by
observation that thoughtful consideration and courtesy will be
denied them by the family? When a girl keeps books, clerks,
or teaches, her rights are recognized. She is as a rule treated
like a lady. Her hours are respected; until housekeepers learn
this first duty of the employer to the <i>employé</i>, it will not be
strange if the better class of girls shun the work, however
much they may need something to do.</p>

<p>There is a general impression—perhaps it would be true to
say that it is a fact—that the comfort and surroundings of a
girl are treated as matters of no importance. No special care
is taken that her kitchen be homelike and airy, and her bedroom
cheery. It is a most deplorable fact that in many households
more attention is given to the stables than the kitchen, but it
<i>is</i> a fact. The kitchen is the household laboratory. It is imperatively
necessary that it be sunny and cheery, but how
many times it is dark and dingy, poorly furnished, and uncomfortably
arranged. The girl who finds her home in the house
of another deserves further, a pleasant room, which shall be hers
and hers alone. It ought to be neatly furnished, comfortably
lighted and heated, and is it purely sentimental to say that she
should have a rocking chair, a sewing table, a book rack and pictures?
No, no. It is simple humanity to make her surroundings
beautiful. The same nature is in her as in you; not only has she
your taste, but a similar social nature; and beside pleasant
surroundings she ought to have some provision made for her
company. A pleasant room in which to entertain them, and
time to give to them without being disturbed. I know a family
in which the girl is allowed occasionally to have her friends to
tea or to invite a friend to spend Sabbath with her. It is understood
that this company never interfere with the work, and
so perfectly do the mistress and maid work together that there
is never any friction resulting from this—to most women—unendurable
liberty. On the contrary, a higher value is put by the
girl on her position. She respects the place which she sees
her mistress respects, and grows more and more of a lady as
she sees that she is treated in all respects like one. In this
same home no Christmas ever goes by without a present to the
girl as much as to any other member of the family. A little
token is always brought her after a trip. In a word, she is valued,
and the appreciation of the family proves it to her.</p>

<p>It is not in the home only that a barrier exists which makes
proud girls shrink from this work which otherwise they would
willingly do. It is a queer comment on our breeding to say
that two thirds of American ladies will not recognize on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the street the girls who do their kitchen work. Absurd! Of
course it is, and it is purely a <i>parvenu</i> trick. The queen of
England herself would blush at such a breach of both common
sense and good breeding. No <i>lady</i> will pass on the street
any one she may know without recognition, least of all will
she pass a faithful, devoted servant, with whom she is associated
in daily work. And if it may chance that both are members of
one church, then by all means their relation should be cordial and
natural. The footing of the church is one of common brotherhood,
and no matter what work one may do, for consistency’s
sake, if for no other reason, there should be an equal position.</p>

<p>Would any girl needing work and competent to do housework
hesitate to take a place where she knew she would be respected,
cared for and honestly dealt with by the lady of the
house? You say though she were fairly treated in her place
she would be despised without. I must differ with you. The
girl who would have the sterling independence and pluck to
adopt housekeeping as a profession, and who would go into the
kitchen of a lady who was willing to honor and uphold her in
her course would not be despised. On the contrary, her very
independence would raise her in value. The loss of social position
entailed by doing housework is purely fancied. Under
the conditions which I have enumerated there could be no loss
of social standing. The fact that almost invariably kitchen
girls have little position does not prove that the kitchen
and its work deprive them of it. Many of the girls (not all, let
us be thankful for it!) doing housework in America are foreigners,
ignorant, stupid, and too often unprincipled. They
are unfit for the work they do. They are hard to deal with.
They care nothing for the interests of the house. They cast a
stigma on the work. But the fact that work of so much importance
is being dragged down is a strong reason for its rescue
by large-minded women and sensible, independent girls.
It is, in truth, a pioneer’s field of infinite possibilities. A field
which, redeemed and possessed, will solve two of the perplexities
of the women of the day—what shall we do with these
strong, good girls of ours, and how shall we save our kitchens
out of the hands of the vandals?</p>

<h2 id="CHAUTAUQUANS_AT_HOME">CHAUTAUQUANS AT HOME.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p class="center">BY CHANCELLOR J. H. VINCENT, D.D.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>After the grand review—dress parade, oratory, music, flags,
and fireworks—comes the common, everyday routine—plow,
pen, needle and nursery. Farewell to the holiday! All hail
to the working day! Between the two there is a vast difference;
and both are good.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the peal of morning bells rolling
over lake and through forest trees, with the warble of wild
wood birds, waking one up to a day of music and eloquence,
Sunday clothes and good society, and the gruff call or dissonant
bell ring of somebody whose business it is to tell you to
be up and at it, at once and for all day, whether you feel like
it or not.</p>

<p>There is a difference between sitting down to a breakfast that
was prepared for you by servants, and getting up to build a
fire and boil a kettle and broil a steak, and wait for all the
household to come down and in, and get through, and give
you a chance to do something else before a half dozen other
things claim your time and thought, and thus make way for a
dozen and one additional things that fill up the unprinted program
of your own domestic or official “assembly” at home.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a precious Bible reading at
eight o’clock, with all the sweetest texts in the book put into
lines or clusters or circles like gems in royal treasure plate, and
the care of a “mussed up” table, a pile of soiled dishes, or
a naughty, nervous, or afflicted child.</p>

<p>There is a difference between one of “dear brother”
Adam’s devotional conferences at nine o’clock, with the fresh
experiences of many hearts (who for the time forget crying children
and crowded kitchen) full of joy and peace and triumph,
with the ingenious interpretations of old, or difficult, or out-of-the-way
texts, with the sweet and fervent prayers that sound as
if heaven were near and not afar off, and as if all the people
one saw filling the Amphitheater were saints of God who had left
the “exceeding glory” for an hour to give Chautauqua a taste
of the celestial life—there is, I say, a difference between all
this and the sweeping and dusting, the stewing and sweating,
the clerking and teaching, the hammering and plowing—and all
the rest of the indoor and outdoor exercises that usurp the
blessed nine o’clock devotional conference hour, for which at
home no bell rings, and to which no organ or solo welcomes.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the eleven o’clock lecture
about life, science and philosophy, full of wit and wisdom, and
the planning and toiling for a dinner in which something will
scorch or spoil, and concerning which peevish and fault finding
words are sure to be spoken by one or more who ought to
be, but are not, considerate and sympathetic.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a two o’clock afternoon concert
of gifted voices, stringed instruments, and organs, and an
aching head and quivering nerves, where rest is refused you,
and the hard, straining, dragging work <i>must</i> go on, whether
you like or loathe it.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the four o’clock “specialties,”
full of help and instruction, and the insipid, fashionable call
that wastes your time, disturbs your conscience, and makes you
wish “society” to the dogs.</p>

<p>There is a difference between the precious five o’clock
Round-Table or vesper hour, with its free conversations (like a
family chat) about simple things connected with our beloved
Circle, with its broad thoughts, its sweet friendships, its holy
prayers, its soothing and uplifting “Day is dying in the West,”
when the sunlight seems like a veritable revelation of the Shekinah,
and the air is vibrant with divinest sympathies—there <i>is</i>
a difference between the Chautauqua five o’clock and the average
five o’clock at home, in field, in street, in shop.</p>

<p>There is a difference between a Chautauqua evening of lectures,
songs, burlesque, boat ride, camp-fire, reception, illuminated
fleet and gorgeous fireworks, and the weariness of a routine
life evening—the physical energy gone, the children out
of sorts, misunderstandings in home, neighborhood or church,
the prospect of a sleepless night, and of an enervating and
irritating to-morrow.</p>

<p>A difference, to be sure, but then remember that these every-days
should be glorified by the Chautauqua days. And remember
that they test the sentiments enkindled and resolutions
formed in the pleasurable excitements, devotional services,
splendid processions and great audiences of the more
favored season.</p>

<p>Fellow-students, let the charm of the Chautauqua days be
felt through all the intervening days. By strong resolve put
high thoughts, tender sympathies, devout aspirations, unwearying
patience, into the most unsentimental, uncomfortable and
vexatious experiences and emergencies of home and business
life, and thus diminish the difference in real value between
Chautauqua and other days.</p>

<h2 id="BISHOP_WARREN_TO_THE_CLASS_OF_1884">BISHOP WARREN TO THE CLASS OF 1884.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>It was a great disappointment to the class of ’84 that no
word of greeting came to them on Commencement Day, this
year, from the beloved “Chautauqua Bishop,” Counselor H.
W. Warren. The mail was the miscreant, however. The letter
did not reach Chautauqua on time, although sent promptly.
Graduates of ’84, as indeed all members of the C. L. S. C.,
will be glad to read his cordial words:</p>

<p>“<i>Beloved graduates of the C. L. S. C., Class of 1884</i>:—I
heartily congratulate you on the fact that you have mounted
four rounds of the ladder of wisdom that stands on the earth,
but reaches into the infinite heavens. It has taken a year to
each step, and the number of the rounds is beyond our arithmetic.</p>

<p>“I congratulate you that you are intimately associated with
one of the greatest intellectual movements of this or any age.
It is great in the range of studies, in the unprecedented number
of thousands pursuing them, and especially great in the
eminently Christian standpoint from which all these studies
are viewed.</p>

<p>“No discovery, theory or science in this age can escape being
viewed from the Christian standpoint. This universe was
made by and for Christ, its king, and nothing that opposes
him shall prosper. Hence, you are on the right foundation,
one that is everlasting. Build thereon, not gold, silver,
precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, whereby you suffer loss, but
build that which shall abide the fire that consumes the world.</p>

<p>“You have not come to this position by ways painful and
humiliating, for wisdom’s ways are ways of pleasantness and
all her paths are peace. What a discovery for a world of misery—paths
of pleasantness to possession of glory and power.
This comes of keeping our heavenly Father in the midst.</p>

<p>“When the famous translator of the Bible into English promised
to make the boy who followed the plow in England know
more of God’s Word than certain famous prelates of his time,
he showed that he knew where all great uplifts of humanity
must begin, not with the well-to-do and content, but with those
who had crying needs and high aspirations. So in this lifting
up of nature into seen harmonies and revelation, till ‘We
study the Word and the works of God’ with equal sense of
their divine origin. The movement must begin with them full
of ambition, and continue till many who follow the plan know
more of the blessed harmony than others who are learned only
in things of material nature. In this great work ‘Do not be
discouraged.’</p>

<p>“I heartily congratulate the classes of 1882 and 1883 on such
a worthy addition to their numbers.</p>

<p>“Let us all go forward, fearing no threatened night, expecting
an occasional eclipse, to show us more stars than we should
ever find by day, and looking beyond cry out:</p>

<p>The long summer vacation, delightful as it is, always causes
a sad falling off in the local circle mails of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.
These letters from the scattered circles of the country
are like the visits of those long absent, or the cordial greetings
of new friends. We miss them in the long months of rest and
are glad to get back again to our table and see the letters
flocking in.</p>

<p>As the year begins it may not be amiss for us to chat a little
with our friends about the work which we must do together in
these local circle pages. It is something like a grand reception.
No one can stay very long, and one can hardly hope to
be more than introduced to the company—unless, indeed, they
happen to be particularly famous in words or deeds. The letters
that come to us will all sooner or later be noticed by us;
but do you not see how impossible it is that all should be given
in full? For the sake of the great Circle we must abridge each
interesting letter, much as we might wish otherwise. And
then, we really can not introduce you unless you will tell us your
name and residence. Of course you <i>mean</i> to do so. We know
that well enough, but you would all be surprised to know how
many reports come to us nameless and homeless. There is
nothing to do but put them in our waste paper basket, much
as we dislike to be so rude to even unknown friends. Again,
you must not complain of us if your report does not appear in
the first issue after it is sent. Please remember that the local
circle department of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> is prepared for the
printer a month before the appearance of the magazine, so
that copy must be on our table at least five weeks before the
appearance of a number, to insure its appearance in a particular
issue. Be sure that <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> will open its doors
to everybody that comes, and just as long as there is “standing
room” in this Local Circle Hall, will gladly admit you.
And now for the letter bag.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New Hampshire</i> has given its own popular title to the <span class="smcap">Keene</span>
local circle, “The Granite C. L. S. C.” This circle is made up of
’87s, having been formed in the autumn of ’83 with an enrollment
of forty members. They meet at the houses of the members,
for, as they say, and we believe them right, the meeting at the
homes cultivates a better social feeling. During the year they
followed a most inviting plan of work, of which they give a
brief but suggestive <i>résumé</i>. “Our method of work has been
varied. Each study has been thoroughly investigated. There
has been familiar conversation in regard to any matter not
well understood, and the question box has been an interesting
feature of the evening. Latterly the plan was adopted
of assigning to different members topics upon which to prepare
questions. They were printed by means of a hectograph,
and distributed among the members previous to the
next meeting. The design was to bring out all points of interest
under consideration. The result has been satisfactory.
A year of the course of study upon which we entered, so
gladly and happily, has quickly passed, and we are already
reaping the benefits in our everyday life. A few individuals
can read in a desultory way with great profit, perhaps, but the
majority require system and regularity in order to gain good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
results. Careless reading is a thing of the past. We have
learned to think. Great changes have been wrought in our
tastes for literature. We seek for something ennobling, striving
to store the mind with enduring knowledge. The fifteenth
of September we again organized with nearly our original number.
Although we have done a good work we feel we can
accomplish more in the future. We have a good start, and
trust we shall land safely in port in ’87.”</p>

<p>Another circle of the Granite State just reported to us is the
“Ivy Leaf,” of <span class="smcap">Newton Junction</span>. A lively band of busy
people they are, too, numbering in their year-old circle of eight
members, a railroad station agent, a telegraph operator, a
school teacher, a music teacher, and so on. The best and
most efficient members are often those who work the busiest
during the day. Our “Ivy Leaf” friends have our heartiest
wishes for success in their coming year’s work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Vermont.</i>—The “Invincibles,” of <span class="smcap">Bradford</span>, organized their
band of seven only last March, but they have found the undertaking
so pleasant that the secretary has written us a glowing account
of their work and methods. She adds a couple of personals
too good to be lost: “Our president is Mrs. A. M. Dickey, who
graduated in 1882, one of the first two C. L. S. C. graduates in
Vermont. She is energetic and self-sacrificing, and with her
for our leader we are sure to succeed. One of our members
has a drive of four miles to attend meetings, and during the
past two years has lost but one session. This will be appreciated
by those who know Vermont in winter. It is a sample
of the ‘Invincibles.’”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Massachusetts.</i>—We shall expect great things from the New
England, and particularly the Massachusetts, division of the C.
L. S. C. this year. The wonderful enthusiasm which animated
the Framingham Assembly ought to keep the circles at the front
the year through. Certainly they have begun well in their reports,
at the head of which we want to put the modest announcement
of the faithful class of ’82, sent us by their secretary, and let
it be a warning to their successors, that they must take care or
they will be outdone by the veterans: “At the Framingham
Assembly, class ’82 held several meetings. The following
officers were elected: President, Mr. Alfred Pike, Holliston,
Mass.; Vice Presidents, Dr. E. M. White, Boston, Mass., and
Mrs. M. J. Farwell, Brocton, Mass.; Secretary, Mrs. M. A. F.
Adams, East Boston, Mass. Mrs. M. J. Farwell will write a
poem for our reunion at Framingham next year, and a hymn
will be written by Mrs. Rosie Baketel. Rev. O. S. Baketel, of
Greenland, N. H., was elected president of the Society of the
‘Hall in the Grove.’”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boston</span> reports two circles unknown to us before. The “People’s
Church” and the “Berkeley” circles. The first is under
the leadership of the pastor of this famous church, Rev. J. H.
Hamilton, and, although organized only a year ago, is a most
enterprising circle. As yet it is small in numbers, there being
scarcely twenty-five members, but it makes up in enthusiasm
what it lacks numerically. This circle issues a paper semi-monthly,
called the <i>People’s Church Chautauquan</i>, the editorship
being undertaken by each member in turn, the other
members furnishing articles upon such subjects as the leader
may assign. This lively little body is not satisfied with prescribing
routine programs, but it plans and carries out a different
program for each evening, and in this way the exercises do
not grow monotonous. The program for the evening of the
Shakspere Memorial was especially interesting.</p>

<p>The “Berkeley” circle was formed in the fall of ’82: again
in October of ’83 the circle was reorganized, meeting alternate
Wednesday nights, and “although,” as they write in their
letter of June last, “many things seemed to conspire against
us, and we lost several members from various causes, and
although the rain and alternate Wednesdays seemed synonymous,
yet our circle ‘still lives’ and grows. Amongst our
number we have a Harvard graduate of ’80, to whom our success
has been largely due during the year just now at a close.”
We hope it will not be long before the faithful “Berkeleys”
will report their forty members gathered together for another
year of work. A circle undaunted by loss of members and rain
storms has the right sort of mettle.</p>

<p>There has been lying on our table all summer the following
charming testimonial (received too late for the July issue) from
<span class="smcap">Readville</span>, a part of the town of Hyde Park, a short distance
from Boston. It paints so happy a picture of home study one
loves to linger over it: “Mother and I are the only ones here
in Readville who are studying. We have all of the books,
encyclopædias and books of reference. We read to each
other and comment on what we have studied. Hardly a day
goes by but most grateful words of praise for what the C. L. S.
C. is doing, fall from our lips. We enjoy <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>
exceedingly. It is a library in itself. A great deal of the work
is review to me, but is just what I want. Believe that none of
the thousands of Chautauquans are more grateful than
mother and myself.”</p>

<p>And to follow this we have a “Pansy Triangle” of farmers’
daughters, two of whom belong to <span class="smcap">Cumberland</span>, <i>Rhode Island</i>,
the third to <span class="smcap">North Attleboro</span>, <i>Massachusetts</i>. Busy girls, and
living far apart as they do, yet they find the time and make the
exertion necessary for frequent meetings. “Our girls,” indeed,
are beginning to take a very prominent part in local circle
work. From every quarter we hear of their busy coteries. The latest
is the <span class="smcap">Tottenville</span> (<i>Staten Island, N. Y.</i>) circle. They
organised a year ago, and at the close of last year’s readings
reported themselves more enthusiastic (if that could be) than
they were in the beginning. Once in every two weeks they
met at the house of some member of the class and spent two
or three hours in talking over the readings; each member prepared
a list of ten questions on one or several of the readings
required; these questions were answered by the class from
memory if possible. Sometimes in connection with the questions
one of the Chautauqua games was played. Thus the
meetings passed quickly and were thoroughly enjoyed by each
member.</p>

<p>A pretty program containing the exercises arranged for each
weekly meeting of the month has been received from <span class="smcap">North
Cambridge</span>. It is printed by hectograph on an engraved card,
thus making both an inexpensive program and a pretty souvenir
of the month’s work. Large circles which have their
exercises arranged for each evening will do well to consider
this manner of arranging their work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Rhode Island.</i>—In the beautiful town of <span class="smcap">Pawtucket</span>, busy
with mills and factories as it is, there was organized last January
a local circle of fifteen members, which has been doing
most excellent work. “Enthusiastic Chautauquans,” they report
themselves. We trust we shall hear from them often during
the coming year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New York.</i>—In a letter received in June from the secretary of
the “Literary Section of the Rochester Academy of Sciences”
(<span class="smcap">Rochester</span>), there was a pleasant prophecy expressed that the
twenty-three members which the circle then numbered might
be able this fall to add a cypher to the right hand of the number
and send us an account of two hundred and thirty enrolled
members, and they add in hearty appreciation of our words:
“In a city so full of cultivated people as ours there ought to be
double that number to which the course would be a blessing.”</p>

<p>The “Spare Minute” circle, of <span class="smcap">New York City</span>, is one of
the many which owe their origin to the interest of one or two
readers. During the year 1882-83 there were two young ladies
reading the course together, and finding it so interesting they
tried to interest others. Soon three young ladies joined them,
and in February they formed a circle, holding meetings once a
month. The circle soon numbered seven, five ladies and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
gentlemen. At a “special,” June 3d, they spent a most delightful
two hours and a half with Latin Literature and Roman
History. Their pastor, Rev. A. W. Halsey, of the Spring
Street Presbyterian Church, met with them and took charge of
the meeting. This circle wrote us of their plans for a C. L. S.
C. picnic to be held in the summer. Was it a success?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>New Jersey.</i>—Everybody found the “Pictures from English
History” in the course of last year a very delightful book, and
at <span class="smcap">Marion</span>, the circle of six organized late in the year was so
pleased that they read it aloud, taking in connection with it the
text-book on English history and the questions from <span class="smcap">The
Chautauquan</span>. A very interesting plan it must have proved.
Our Marion friends hope this year to be able to report an increase
of members and of interest in the work in that place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Pennsylvania.</i>—The reorganizing of the local circles has
brought out many plans for the important work of collecting the
old members again into the ranks, and of bringing in new
members. That wonderfully energetic body, the <span class="smcap">Allegheny</span>
circle of the class of ’87, did a capital thing in sending out a
large number of copies of the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Allegheny</span>, September 24, ’84.</p>

<p>“<i>Dear Friend</i>:—The Allegheny circle, class of ’87, C. L. S. C., will
hold their first meeting for the term 1884-5, at 7:30 p. m., on Monday,
September 29, 1884, at 55 Ohio Street, corner East Diamond. Members
and friends cordially invited to be present.</p>

<p>“Have you any friends who may be made happier, wiser, and better,
by using the spare moments of life in useful, pleasant and profitable
reading? If so, bring them with you. Do you know any persons who
have read part of the C. L. S. C. course, who, becoming discouraged,
have given up the work? Speak to such ones and induce them to begin
again and finish the course. We invite all to meet with us who
wish to enter upon a four years’ course of useful reading, under the direction
and wisdom of some of the best educators of the country.”</p>

</div>

<p>They wisely preceded this by issuing for September 9th the
following invitation: “Yourself and friends are invited to
attend the first annual picnic excursion of the Allegheny circle,
C. L. S. C., class of ’87, to be given Tuesday, September
9th, 1884, at Conoquenessing Grove and Rocks.”</p>

<p>Similar to the letter was a notice sent out by the circle at
<span class="smcap">Omaha</span>, <i>Nebraska</i>, in connection with the Popular Education
circular, which explains the methods of the C. L. S. C. The
following announcement was included in the notice: “the
branch organized in this city last fall, and known as the Omaha
C. L. S. C., is now arranging for next year’s work. A preliminary
meeting will be held in Y. M. C. A. Hall, September 16th,
at eight o’clock. All members of the circle, and those intending
to read the course for 1884-5, are invited to be present.”
These plans are always effective, and they have the added
value of being simple.</p>

<p>At <span class="smcap">Eldred</span> (<i>Pa.</i>), the local circle was reorganized in September
with an increased membership. In honor of Chautauqua’s
distinguished visitor from England, the circle will hereafter be
known as the “Fairbairn Circle.”</p>

<p>We conclude from the encouraging report which has reached
us from <span class="smcap">Berwick</span>, of the past work of the circle there, that
they have undoubtedly resumed work again this fall. The
second year of the class of ’86 closed very successfully, with
an increased membership. The interest manifested at the
outset continued to the last. The advancement and thoroughness
in study were marked. Through the medium of the
Y. M. C. A. the C. L. S. C. enjoyed lectures during the year
from eminent Chautauquans. Among them were Dr. Lyman
Abbot, Wallace Bruce and Mr. Frank Beard.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Carbondale</span> circle is a flourishing, wide-awake member
of the great C. L. S. C. It numbers among its members
clergymen, bankers, lawyers, business men, and many of the
most accomplished ladies of the city, prominent among the
latter, the popular author, Mrs. G. R. Alden, with whose <i>nom
de plume</i>, “Pansy,” the class of 1887 has been christened.
The circle closed its first year June 25th with an “English
Night.” The “Customs,” “Life,” “Holidays,” “Parks,”
“Roads,” etc., were subjects of short and pithy essays. The
London <i>Graphic’s</i> bird’s-eye view of London from a balloon
was the occasion of much interest and inquiry. Mrs. Alden
transformed the circle into a party of tourists, and made a
delightful and instructive excursion to England (on paper).
After the circle’s return from England the leader of the Round-Table
surprised the circle by an innovation on the “question
slip” plan, in shape of ices and other refreshments. The circle
finds the evenings are too short, and are discussing the
advisability of meeting oftener. Its second year’s work begun
on Garfield day, by a public meeting announced by press and
pulpit, reviewing the past year’s reading and taking in new
members.</p>

<p>Another wide awake Pennsylvania circle is that at <span class="smcap">Elizabeth</span>.
It was organized just a year ago. Since that time it
has given two public entertainments which were well received.
At the last meeting, when the circle adjourned for three months,
the following resolution was unanimously adopted: “<i>Resolved</i>,
That we have found pleasure and profit in pursuing
the course of reading laid down by the C. L. S. C., and in attending
the meetings of the local circle, and we hereby individually
pledge ourselves that if circumstances permit we will
follow up the readings until we have completed the four years’
course.”</p>

<p>The “Whiting” circle (so called from its president, Dr. H. C.
Whiting, of Dickinson College), of <span class="smcap">Carlisle</span>, had enrolled
last year its first year of work—thirty-two members. Their
methods of work were excellent. The circle resolved itself
into groups of five or six, to meet each week for the study of
the several subjects. The meeting of the whole circle was
generally held monthly. Some time prior to the general meeting
the president arranged a program and assigned work to
the members. The plan was varied from time to time. Occasionally
a whole work was divided into topics to be reviewed
and summed up in essays. Again, special subjects connected
with a work were assigned for essays; then again, questions
were given to the several members, upon which preparation
was to be made, and answers rendered by the members of the
circle, with comments by the president. These exercises have
been supplemented by excellent music. Last year they
prophesied a material increase in this year’s membership. We
trust it has come.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Ohio.</i>—The closing exercises of the “Home” circle, of
<span class="smcap">Cleveland</span>, were of more than usual interest. They were
held June 23d, nearly every one of the twenty-one members
being present. A fine literary and musical entertainment was
given, and refreshments were served, after which the president,
W. P. Payne, delivered a very forcible address on the
Chautauqua Idea. We wish we had space to quote it, but can
give only the closing lines: “Sooner or later we shall learn
that the great Man works not before men with gold and greed,
with affectation and noise; but withdrawing himself, alone
with his soul, into the inner temple, in solitude solves the
problems of highest and deepest interest to men. I know not
who the coming Man shall be, but I believe that to Chautauqua
shall be the glory of his coming and the praise.”</p>

<p>Another Ohio circle of great interest is that of <span class="smcap">Tallmadge</span>.
It was organized in October, 1883, with six members, all of
whom belong to the class of ’87. Eight local members were
added to that number before the close of the year. The meetings,
which are held semi-monthly, were well attended. A
charming program was carried out on Longfellow’s day.</p>

<p>About the time that the Tallmadge circle came into existence,
a pleasant circle was formed at <span class="smcap">Findlay</span>, of the same state.
The membership grew to the goodly proportion of twenty-nine
regular members, and reported to us at the closing of the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
that their meetings had been unusually profitable and
pleasant.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Indiana.</i>—We are indebted to the <span class="smcap">Terre Haute</span> circle for
one of the most beautiful programs which has ever reached us.
It is satin backed and hand-painted. A lovely little memento
of what must have been a charming evening. The annual reception
of the club was the occasion of its use, and a correspondent
writes us that one of these pretty affairs was laid at
every one of the sixty plates spread for the banquet. The
painting was all done by members of the circle. Prominent
on the program was an admirable poem, “A Symposium of
Classic Tales,” by Rev. Alfred T. Kummer, of the Centenary
M. E. Church in Terre Haute. We quote the opening stanzas,
and had we space we would gladly give it all:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">All hail! ye noble seekers after truth;</div>
<div class="verse">All hail! ye spirits growing still in youth,</div>

<div class="verse">Plows furrows deep, but brings us home at length.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A new Memorial day has been adopted by the <span class="smcap">Danville</span>
Circle, in honor of the late Bishop Simpson. This circle
closed a prosperous year’s work on June 20th. And at <span class="smcap">Martinsville</span>
of the same state the circle closed the year by
a brilliant reception at the opera house. Several hundred
invitations were sent out, and the house was filled with
an appreciative audience. From the neighboring town of
<span class="smcap">Spencer</span> a C. L. S. C. delegation of twenty-two ladies was
present. The Martinsville circle furnished a rich program,
and sent their friends away deeply impressed by the sterling
worth of the C. L. S. C. work. We are pleased to notice also
a new circle of twelve members at <span class="smcap">West Newton</span>, organized
in November, 1883. We hope to hear the particulars of their
work soon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Illinois.</i>—A letter from <span class="smcap">Pana</span> contains a suggestion which
might, we are sure, be adopted successfully by any circle: “As
an addition to our program, each lady is requested to bring to
every meeting some selection that seems to her particularly
fine. It is to be written out, so that it may be pasted into a
book that shall be kept as a sort of memorial of the society.”
This circle writes that they had their first public entertainment
this winter, which their friends kindly pronounced a success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Michigan.</i>—We are pleased to introduce for the first time a
circle of fourteen in <span class="smcap">Grand Rapids</span>. They write us that they
have been enjoying a prosperous existence since October last,
and are looking hopefully forward to an increase this year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Wisconsin.</span>—Two more Wisconsin circles from whom we
have heard before in these columns have recently sent us notices
of interesting sessions. At <span class="smcap">Markesan</span> the circle commemorated
Garfield’s death by an afternoon session, at which
an able program was carried out.</p>

<p>From <span class="smcap">Rusk</span> a lady writes: “We are only a small circle of
six members living in the country, but try to be very zealous
Chautauquans. To say that we are thankful for the institution
of the C. L. S. C. would but feebly express our feelings,
for we truly feel that it brightens our homes and helps us enjoy
life. We are all housekeepers, and have all its attending
cares, yet we feel that the pleasure we get from these readings
more than compensates us for the little additional labor in the
direction of the C. L. S. C. We are doing the work much
more thorough this year than our first year, and find the better we
do our work the more pleasure, as well as profit, we derive
from it.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Minnesota.</i>—The “Flour City” circle of <span class="smcap">Minneapolis</span> writes
that “as we could not expect to visit Chautauqua this summer
we decided to celebrate the closing of our first year at our own
lovely Minnetonka. In answer to an invitation from a lady
member of our circle we went to the lake to spend the day
with her; and a wonderful day we had, going by sail twenty
miles to the cottage, where we were met by words and faces
full of welcome.” At the gay banquet, which was one of the
features of the day, they found a unique device: “As we sat
down to the sumptuously loaded and elegantly decorated table,
some curiosity was aroused at the sight of a small sack by the
side of each plate, filled with something, and tied with bright
ribbon and labeled ‘F. C. C., 1887.’ Presently, as one noticed
that the sacks were of fine bolting cloth, through which the
flour began to sift, the riddle was solved. The badge of the
‘Flour City’ circle is a sack of flour, and we wore them proudly
home. Next dinner was discussed, and everything proved to
be of the best—appetites and all. Then came the feast of
reason, and so pleasant did we find it that we lingered quite
as long as over that of strawberries and cream.” Fishing,
boating and gathering lilies finished their happy day. The
“Flour City” circle certainly could not have had a more delightful
time—even at Chautauqua.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Missouri.</i>—The third annual meeting of the literary societies
of <span class="smcap">Carthage</span> took place in June. A C. L. S. C. class is
one of the prominent members of the association, and on this
occasion, as its part of the entertainment, took the audience
on an imaginary tour. The <i>Carthage Press</i> thus speaks of the
conductors of the tour: “Mrs. Ross was a bright companion
in the trip from Carthage to New York; the pictures of the
ocean voyage and a visit to Scotland were given by Mrs.
Nailon; Miss Belle Ross escorted the party to England in so
charming a manner that all hated to give her up, but Mrs.
Clarkson proved a worthy successor as she guided them
through France; Germany received so original and philosophical
a treatment from Mrs. Rombauer that we would fain
have lingered longer in the Fatherland; Mrs. Miller took us to
Greece and explained entertainingly all the wonders to be seen
there; Miss Hayne showed ancient Rome; Miss Devore’s description
of the Rome of to-day was so well written and so
vivid that we felt as if we had really stood in old Rome in the
rooms of new Rome; Mrs. Heywood gave the trip from Italy
home to America; and Mrs. Case closed with an entertaining
account of a visit to Lake Chautauqua.” A capital idea for
some of our friends who are longing for “something new.”
At about the same time of this celebration the <span class="smcap">St. Louis</span> circles,
“Vincent” and “Round Table,” held their third annual
meeting. These two circles number jointly about seventy
members, and they prepared for this entertainment an exceedingly
fine program. One attractive feature of the entertainment
was the “Tangent,” a monthly paper made up of
original articles contributed by the members of the circles, and
read by an editor. The idea is to develop and strengthen any
latent literary talent possessed by the members, and to furnish
an audience for their productions without the embarrassment
of making known the authorship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Kansas.</i>—From <span class="smcap">Emporia</span> we had the pleasure of receiving
in June a pleasant letter from a faithful C. L. S. C. worker in
that town. The circle was organized only a year ago, but soon
became so large that it had to be divided. Our correspondent
thinks it would be hard to find more enthusiastic workers.
She says: “We have resolved to be ever true and faithful in
the grand work. It is generally understood that nothing but
sickness—not even Kansas mud—will keep us at home
Chautauqua evenings. We have imitated Cæsar in his plan
of a speedy construction of bridges—ours, not across the
Rhine, but across the muddy street, for some of us live off the
sidewalk.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>California.</i>—Our thanks are due to the “Vincent” local circle
of <span class="smcap">Sacramento</span>, for a copy of their excellent rules of government.
From the appearance and character of these regulations
we conclude that our “Vincent” friends have come to
stay.</p>

<p>In the scattered farming community of <span class="smcap">San Lorenzo</span>, across
the bay from San Francisco, there has been for five years a
lively circle of C. L. S. C. workers. It began with but two
members, and has increased until there are eleven workers in
the club. “During the nine months’ study of each year
scarcely a week has passed,” writes the secretary, “without
our meeting together for review and talk over the lesson. We
have never allowed ourselves to fall behind in the course as
marked out in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>.”</p>

<p>In a letter received too late for the July issue of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
the secretary of the <span class="smcap">Yuba City</span> local circle writes: “I believe
our local circle has had a report in your columns every
year, and we desire to be represented this, our third year, which
finds us even more zealous (were it possible) than any preceding
one, and realizing more and more each day the great benefit
of this systematic course of reading. Our method is to carefully
go through the lesson as it is marked out in <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>,
and to have a general exchanging of ideas and
views on all its principal topics. This consumes so much of
our time that we have had as yet but little outside work, such
as essays, and the like. We observe all Memorial days.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Los Angeles</span> has a very interesting and prosperous circle.
It was formed in 1881 with twelve members. In 1882-3 they
kept up the readings, but becoming discouraged they abandoned
the regular meetings until October of 1883, when a circle
of thirty-nine members was reorganized. The plan which
their president has found most successful has been to bring
carefully prepared questions into the class and encourage free
conversation on the book study of the week. The topics in
<span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> she assigns to some gentleman or lady
particularly interested in the special themes, who comes prepared
with illustration, demonstration, and experiment, to instruct
and please. The work grows, and its influence is being
felt in the strangely mixed populace of that growing coast city.</p>

<p>Another Pacific Coast Branch is that of <span class="smcap">Bakersfield</span>. Its
members, twenty-five in all, include ministers, lawyers, judges,
doctors, farmers, bankers, and their wives, together with a
large number of lads and lassies, most of whom are enthusiastically
interested in their studies. There is one German
lady now in her sixty-second year, who is endeavoring to compete
with other members of the class, and will come out victorious
if she continues to be as thorough in the next three years
as she has been in the past few months. The evening gatherings
are enlivened occasionally by essays, readings, music, etc.
This circle predicts for the coming year a membership of forty.
We hope that the prediction may be verified.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mary H. Field, the competent and enthusiastic secretary
of the Pacific Coast Branch of the C. L. S. C., has sent
us the following full report of last year’s work in her district:
“The Pacific Coast Branch of the C. L. S. C. has grown and
prospered during the past year. Its affairs were all so well
ordered and arranged by her predecessor that but little
remained for the secretary to do save to carry out their good
designs. It has been like sailing on a smooth sea in a well
manned ship, with all the machinery in perfect order, and with
a fresh breeze filling every sail. The work has consisted
chiefly in an immense correspondence, the issuing of three
thousand circulars, the writing of series of newspaper articles,
and the keeping of records and accounts.</p>

<p>“I have the pleasure of reporting six hundred and twenty-four
new members, and the renewal of more than two hundred
old members. About forty circles are reported as being in
prosperous condition. Probably in no other part of the United
States is there so scattering a population as on this coast, and
it is in the isolated hamlets, the solitary homes, and in the one
man or one woman “circles” that the C. L. S. C. does its most
salutary work.</p>

<p>“Southern California is a growing center of C. L. S. C.
influence. The secretary deeply regrets that Monterey is so
far from Los Angeles and San Diego, and that those excellent
circles are not represented there.</p>

<p>“It has been my sad duty during the past year to write the little
star, which means <i>deceased</i>, against several names in our record.
Against one, that of Mrs. M. H. McKee, of San José, I mingled
deep personal regret with my official task. Alas for us
that one so bright, so useful, so variously endowed, should
have passed from earth in the midst of her years and usefulness.”</p>

<p>From Carlisle, Pa., we have received a note announcing the
death of a member of the class of ’85. “In August last Miss
Annie M. Green ‘finished her course’ on earth. Our fellow
student was ambitious, energetic, and enthusiastic. She has
‘passed through the gates’ of the eternal city, there to reach
those heights of knowledge which will satisfy her loftiest aims,
while we who remain ‘press on, reaching after those things
which are before.’”</p>

<p>All communications for the ’85 class page should be addressed
to C. M. Nichols, Springfield, Ohio, so that they will
reach him by the 10th day of the month before the date of the

<p>The purpose in raising a Memorial Fund is to purchase a

<p>How many members of the class of ’85 are still in the ranks?
Will Miss Kimball inform us?</p>

<p>Ladies writing the officers of the class will please affix “Miss”
or “Mrs.” to their names, as may be the truth in their cases,
so that no mistakes may be made by such of the members of
the class as are bachelors!</p>

<p>President Underwood is in charge of a circle at Meriden,
Conn., is also president of an association of thirty-three Sunday-schools,
has three meetings to preside over during the
next ninety days, two addresses to make, and is to tell two circles,
in a lecture, why he is a Chautauquan. Then he has an
exacting and absorbing private business to attend to! Evidently
Mr. Underwood is not a loafer!</p>

<h4>NOTES FROM THE CLASS OF ’85 AT SOUTH FRAMINGHAM.</h4>

<p>The Class of ’85, N. E. Branch, had their headquarters at
the N. E. Assembly in the Congregational Social Tent. Their
thanks are due to Rev. G. B. De Bevoise, Sunday-school Secretary
for Massachusetts, for his courtesy and kindness in
opening the tent to them.</p>

<p>Prize examinations of the class of ’85 in English Literature
and in American Literature were held. The prizes offered were
a copy of Whittier’s Birthday Book and Longfellow’s Birthday
Book, with the autographs of the class. Miss Jennie M.
Daniels, of West Newton, Mass., took the prize in American
Literature, and Miss M. L. Stevens, of Readville, Mass., in
English Literature.</p>

<p>We regret that our faithful secretary and treasurer, Mr. A. B.
Comey, felt compelled to resign. He has shown great interest
in the organization, and spent much time and energy and
money in its interest.</p>

<p>Miss Antoinette Tucker, of Hopkinton, Mass., the new class
secretary, has been one of the chief supporters of the large
C. L. S. C. Reading Class in her town, and is greatly interested
in the whole movement.</p>

<p>The class had a social reunion on the evening of July 25th.
Fifty members were present. They were honored by the presence,
as an invited guest, of ex-Governor Claflin, who was one of
the chief supporters of the whole assembly at Lakeview. An
address of greeting was given by Rev. J. E. Fullerton, president
of the class. Remarks were also made by J. C. Haskell,
of Auburn, Me., one of the new vice presidents, and the retiring
secretary, A. B. Comey, Esq. An original poem was read by
Miss Tilden, of Chelsea. Recitations followed by Miss Evans
and Miss Daniels. A poem entitled “Framingham Bells,” of
March, 1882, was read by the author, Miss Phœbe A. Holder,
a member of the class. A song written for the occasion by
Miss Evans was sung. Miss Tayler and Miss Stevens added
much to the occasion by their solos.</p>

<p>Mr. J. C. Haskell, the new vice president, is leader of a
class in Auburn.</p>

<p>Miss Celia E. Valentine, of New Gloucester, Me., vice president,
is one of the leading spirits in the large circle in her
town.</p>

<p>Mr. B. T. Thompson, of South Framingham, Mass. (they
call him Dea), is a man whose time and purse are generously
enlisted in moral, educational, and religious interests.</p>

<p>The class voted to send around circular letters during the
winter, that the members might become more interested in each
other and learn the different plans of conducting circles. All
the members of the class of ’85 in New England are requested
to send a postal card containing their names and addresses, and
all the other pleasant words they choose to the president, Rev.
J. E. Fullerton, that none may be forgotten.</p>

<h3>TO NEW ENGLAND MEMBERS OF ’87.</h3>

<h4>NEW ENGLAND SECRETARY’S REPORT.</h4>

<p>At the Lakeview Assembly, in South Framingham, Mass.,
the New England branch of the class of ’87 was well represented,
three hundred and fifty members of the class being on
the ground at different times. In the procession on “C. L. S.
C. Day” nearly three hundred members of ’87 followed the
Pansy banner. The class gave proof of enterprise and enthusiasm
from the very first; its class meetings were held on every
day of the Assembly—except Sunday—and were well attended.
Class headquarters were secured and tastefully decorated. To
meet the expenses of headquarters, banner, and other expenditures,
the members present at Lakeview were invited to contribute
twenty-five cents each into the treasury. This contribution
was optional with each member. One hundred and
eighty-seven responded, supplying enough funds to meet the
expenses during the Assembly, and leave $16.82 in the treasury.</p>

<p>On the evening of “C. L. S. C. Day” the ’87s held a social
reunion at their headquarters, where a pleasing musical and
literary entertainment was given by members of the class.</p>

<p>Much of the class enthusiasm was doubtless due to the president,
Rev. George Benedict, of Hanson, Mass., who was
untiring in his efforts to secure the highest degree of class
prosperity.</p>

<p>On Friday, July 25, the following class officers were elected
for this year:</p>

<p>Presidents—Rev. F. M. Gardner, Lawrence, Mass.; Mr. E.
A. Gowen, Biddeford, Me.; Rev. Benj. Merrill, Swanzey, N. H.</p>

<p>Vice Presidents—Mrs. F. B. Gilman, Springfield, Vt.; Rev.
George Benedict, Hanson, Mass.; Mr. O. A. Jeffers, Pawtucket,
R. I.; Miss Mary Bradford, Mystic Bridge, Conn.</p>

<p>Secretary—Sadie M. Corey, Brighton, Mass.</p>

<p>Assistant Secretary—Miss Nellie F. Crocker, Providence, R. I.</p>

<p>Treasurer—Mrs. David Morrill, Allston, Mass.</p>

<p>A constitution was adopted by the class; in accordance with
Article 4 of this constitution, the executive committee has
appointed the first mid-year reunion to be held in Boston, on
the day after Thanksgiving, at one o’clock p. m., in the vestry
of the People’s Church, corner of Columbus Avenue and
Berkeley Street. This will be a social reunion, with an entertainment
comprising vocal and instrumental music, a class
poem, and an address. At this meeting the date and place of
the second mid-year reunion will be announced. A few items
of business will come before the meeting, the most important
being in regard to hiring or building a class headquarters at
Lakeview for next year. The executive committee will try to
make this reunion an enjoyable occasion, and it is hoped that
as many as possible of New England ’87s will be present.</p>

<p>2. Q. From what tongues are elements taken that our English
speech of to-day possesses? A. From every important
tongue on the globe.</p>

<p>3. Q. To what three languages is the indebtedness of the
English tongue disclosed, in almost every sentence framed?
A. The French, the Latin, and the Greek.</p>

<p>4. Q. From what period does modern English speech date?
A. From about 1550 A. D.</p>

<p>5. Q. For the two preceding centuries how is English speech
characterized? A. As old English.</p>

<p>6. Q. For the next preceding two centuries, 1150 to 1350, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
is English speech denominated? A. As Semi-Saxon, the outgrowth
of the Norman invasions and conquests.</p>

<p>7. Q. What is the period called for five hundred years preceding
the Semi-Saxon period? A. The Anglo-Saxon period.</p>

<p>8. Q. From what did the Anglo-Saxon speech spring? A.
From the mingling of Teutonic dialects on British soil.</p>

<p>9. Q. To what great primitive family of languages does the
Teutonic belong? A. The Aryan.</p>

<p>10. Q. From whom are those who used this primitive Aryan
speech supposed to have descended? A. From Japhet, one of
the sons of Noah.</p>

<p>11. Q. By what nations are the languages belonging to the
Aryan family spoken? A. By nearly all modern civilized
nations.</p>

<p>12. Q. What are some of the causes which contribute to
make many of the changes in speech? A. Differences in climate
and natural scenery; different methods of increasing
vocabularies; different methods of inflection; the development
of different muscles of the vocal organs; the manner of
accenting, pronouncing and spelling words.</p>

<p>13. Q. To what conclusion may these, and other considerations,
lead us as to the origin of all existing and historic
tongues? A. That they had their origin from one primitive
stock.</p>

<p>14. Q. What is the materialistic evolutionist’s theory of the
origin of speech? A. That a race of articulate men, being
developed from races of inarticulate creatures, built up from
brute sounds existing human speech.</p>

<p>15. Q. What are three strong objections to this theory? A.
It lacks the support of well-established facts. It is opposed by
the fact that primitive tongues show a descent, but in no case
a radical ascent. It is contrary to Scripture history.</p>

<p>16. Q. What is a second theory as to the origin of speech?
A. That a race of articulate beings, who were created at one
time, but in different localities, developed in those different
localities the different historic and existing tongues.</p>

<p>17. Q. What are some of the objections to this theory? A.
It is in conflict with a large number of facts pointing to the
strict unity of the human race, and is opposed to sacred history.</p>

<p>18. Q. What is a third view as to the origin of speech? A.
That a race of fallen beings descended from a representative
head that had at the start command of either a perfect speech,
or else readily developed it as occasion required; that his
descendants adopted this speech, which subsequently, by
some strange modification of the vocal organs, was violently
disturbed.</p>

<p>19. Q. What are some of the things that can be said in favor
of this theory? A. It is not opposed by either physical or linguistic
science; and it has the support of sacred history.</p>

<p>20. Q. What inference does the author draw as to the
probable origin and development of human speech? A. That
it is both God-given and from human invention.</p>

<p>21. Q. By what laws ought speech to be governed? A. By
the same laws essentially as are found in force throughout the
various domains of matter and mind.</p>

<p>22. Q. What number of laws does the author formulate as a
linguistic code? A. Fifteen.</p>

<p>23. Q. What is the first law? A. The law of symbolization.</p>

<p>24. Q. What are three ways in which this law is illustrated?
A. By imitative words, by the formation of new words from
existing roots, by symbolizing the past.</p>

<p>25. Q. What is the second law? A. The law of development.</p>

<p>26. Q. What does the law of development require as to
changes in and additions to language? A. That they should
be rather by development from its own resources than by the
adoption of foreign words.</p>

<p>27. Q. What does the third law, that of definiteness, require
as to an expression of ideas? A. That it shall give the person
addressed the least possible conscious mental effort in order
to understand.</p>

A. To give with definiteness and elegance the largest number
of ideas with the fewest and shortest words possible.</p>

<p>29. Q. In what does the law of selection consist? A. In
giving the utmost effect to expression in the fewest words.</p>

<p>30. Q. How does it differ from the law of economy? A. It
not only reduces a given quantity, but reduces it with wise
discrimination.</p>

<p>31. Q. Upon what does the law of suggestion fix attention?

Write something between the lines.</p>

<p>32. Q. How are the tendencies to conform to the law of
analogous usage seen? A. In the change of irregular into
regular forms or inflections and speech.</p>

<p>33. Q. What suggestion is made in regard to words introduced
into English from other languages? A. That they shall,
both in structure and pronunciation, doff their foreign and don
the English dress.</p>

<p>34. Q. How is the law of variation and contrast in speech
shown? A. By an examination of standard literature.</p>

<p>35. Q. In what way do we find this law illustrated by Shakspere?
A. In the midst of the highest tragedy he gives us the
lowest comedy.</p>

period.</p>

<p>38. Q. What are some of the rules that are indorsed by

parts in the formation of compound words? A. That they
shall be taken from the same tongue.</p>

<p>46. Q. What class of words do several laws of language demand
still further that English-speaking people shall use? A. Such
words as are characteristic of their mother tongue.</p>

<p>47. Q. Why do the Scotch love Burns, the Americans Whittier,
and the English-speaking world Longfellow as they love
no others? A. Because they use the language of purpose, of
affection, and of passion which finds its best utterances through
the means of simple Anglo-Saxon words.</p>

<h3>THE OUTLOOK FROM THE PLAINFIELD OFFICE.</h3>

<p>He must be a very indifferent man, indeed, who does not
feel the quick flush of pride at the growth and success of the
institutions with which he is connected. Doubly glad will he
be if it be one for whose enlargement he has labored.</p>

<p>We surmise that there are very few of our readers—many of
whom are more than members of the C. L. S. C., being actual
workers for its interests—but that will be eager to know the
present outlook for our work from the Plainfield office, anxious
to know what are the prospects for 1884-’85.</p>

<p>Nowhere excepting at the central office is it possible to
sound our work, to know its breadth, its depth, the permanency
of its interest among our members, and its growth among the
people. Here we can gauge its dimensions. And, perhaps,
the first sign, and certainly it is a most significant one, is that
which every casual visitor at our business headquarters must
observe at once, as he looks in upon the busy workers of the
office; the work is too big for its quarters. The mammoth
mails are swelling beyond the prescribed boundaries. The
office must grow with the C. L. S. C., and next spring it is decreed
that there shall be a Chautauqua floor at Plainfield instead
of an office, and that there, side by side, shall be found
the business centers of the two great divisions of the “new
education”—the C. L. S. C. and the Chautauqua University.</p>

<p>Of equal import is the work that the office secretary and her
associates are being called upon to do this fall. Much work is
always the sign of growth. It proves a demand for that which
you are able to supply. It shows that you are filling a needed
place. The C. L. S. C. never made more work than it does
now—the most conclusive proof that the cause is prospering.
The mails have become enormous. The average number of
letters daily received through September and up to this date
was over six hundred. These letters are the pulses of public
feeling toward this work. They contain queries of all kinds
respecting the methods of the Circle; they ask for circulars in
great quantities, saying that there are everywhere people
waiting to receive them; they proclaim enlarged boundaries
and steadily increasing strength.</p>

<p>In many towns where the membership has always been
large it has been doubled this fall. On October 4th the class
of ’88 numbered over 3,000 members, a much larger number
than the class of ’87 had at the same time last year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>One particularly encouraging feature is the vigor of the
work. The C. L. S. C. grows up <i>strong</i>. There are records
innumerable in those Cyclopean books at the Secretary’s office
of readers who have caught the true idea, that education is
life work, and they have joined the C. L. S. C. to stay. There
are numbers of established circles, and this fall’s records are
increasing the number of post-graduate readers, and the list of
circles which have become fixed institutions.</p>

<p>There are, too, some interesting facts to be gleaned from a
careful study of these records. We like to know where lie the
strongholds of our work, among what kind of people are its
rank and file, and here are the answers to our queries. The
outlook for the present year shows that, as has been true heretofore,
the leaders in the C. L. S. C. are the states of New
York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, California and New England,
that close in their train follow Illinois, Iowa and Indiana;
that the class of people taking up the work is now, as
always, the busy class, whose lives are full of thought and
work and plans; that their ages, on an average, lie between
twenty and forty years.</p>

<p>The outlook from the Plainfield office is to-day upon an ever
growing band of earnest hearted men and women, gathered
from all the states and territories of the Union, and from over
the seas; it is upon an enthusiasm never before surpassed by
any body of students in any land, and it presages, beyond
doubting, the largest, grandest year in the history of the movement.</p>

<h3>THE DECLINE OF ORATORY.</h3>

<p>The political campaign affords a good view of the decline
of oratory and of its chief causes. Oratory is not a less potent
force on account of any decrease in the production of the talents
which under proper culture form the orator. Humanity
is probably richer in such gifts. And yet oratory had notice
to prepare for an eclipse when printing was invented, and the
shadow upon oratorical influence has grown larger in each
half century until the illuminating office has passed almost
entirely over to the press. In the old campaigns, the orator
furnished a feeble press with facts and arguments; in the present
campaign the positions are exactly reversed. The press furnishes
the ideas, the arguments, the facts, the illustrations.
The stump speaker no longer invents; he crams. He is not
an original thinker, developing lines of attack and defense,
fortifying weak positions and fashioning a line of battle by a
single speech. He is the mouthpiece of party opinion, the
obedient servant of party tactics, and the illustrator and peddler
of other men’s thoughts. And all this work is cut out for
him by men who in the press represent both public opinion
and party councils of war. Men are living who can remember
when the words of Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Seward, Lincoln,
were waited for; and the words came—they were battle cries
and marching orders. Now nobody waits for any orator, and
the orator gets his instructions from the press. It is not very
wise to attribute the change to the decline of statesmanship
and leadership. It is not clear that the former has declined;
it is certain that the latter has not. But the leader is no longer
a man who makes a speech, but he has become a man who
writes an article or plans a campaign in which the telegraph,
the literary bureau, the campaign document, and the contriving
genius in himself do the large work. He puts orators into
the field and tells them what to say. They are his instruments,
very useful instruments, because the love of public speaking is
still strong in men; but still oratory uses the tools of the man
with a pen and types.</p>

<p>The causes of the changed relations of writer and speaker
are made conspicuous by the campaign. A carefully prepared
and printed document can be circulated in millions of copies;
a speech can be heard by from one to five thousand people
only. These words of ours are addressed to one hundred and
fifty thousand readers; he is a genius, before whom this present
writer would take off his hat, who can collect five thousand
men to listen to him on any subject. The press has the large
audience, a vast congregation never dreamed of until the
press and swift modes of communication made the immense
audience possible. Another cause is that, while we have more
talents, there are competing demands for the services of those
which prevail in argument and persuasion. Fifty years ago
this country had no great editors; it could easily furnish a liberal
supply of orators. Now it uses up a large amount of its oratorical
ability in the editorial rooms. Other pursuits have
silenced tongues that might have moved mankind, by employing
the brains in mercantile and industrial work on large lines.
Many a great railroad man might have been a great orator.
But the diversion of born pleaders and debaters to the newspapers
sufficiently accounts for their absence from the stump.</p>

<p>The genius for mastery over political thought and action is
not blind; it has gone into the press because it could prevail
and direct and conquer in the press. It is a natural consequence
of the shifting of the central point of persuasive power
that we perceive a third cause of the decline of oratory. The
press is at the center, the headquarters so to say, while the
orator is out in the field making a raid or conducting a skirmish.
Centralization is an inevitable effect of the press, the
telegraph and the railway. Some effects are to be regretted
as we regret the existence of unpleasant incidents of wholesome
movements in progress. But our regret can hardly extend
to the power of directing a party campaign from a center
of the field. It is, in our day, the only way of making it a distinct
engagement. It would be a series of isolated skirmishes
if we did not have a headquarters and a central committee.
This central power speaks in telegraphic clicks and printed
words. The orator may be a dashing lieutenant, he can not
be a general.</p>

<p>Oratory has taken a subordinate position. The fact has its
bearings on deliberative assembly government. Congress can
not have great orators in an age when the public will is expressed
by editors, and the shape of bills fixed by the newspapers.
The business of the legislators is restricted on all
sides by the press. The discussions of a legislature are feebleness
itself in the presence of the ringing and decisive editorials
of influential newspapers. The press hems in the assemblymen
within narrow limits of choice; and a speech can not
be great when it can not command the field, but only a corner
of it. All this does not mean that oratory is dying or to die;
it has simply taken a lower place as an agent in argument and
persuasion. Nor do we mean that great orators are no
longer possible. A great orator, by natural endowment,
may make and hold a commanding place—by the
aid of the press. But the greatness which will do this must be
of a prodigious power and altogether exceptional magnitude.
The best men will, as a rule, seek the easier paths to influence,
and these lie through types and ink. To speak well will always
be an admirable and effective art; but the orator must serve
and follow the press. He is a necessary part of the machinery
of persuasion, but he is no longer the driving wheel.</p>

<h3>THE NEW ORLEANS WORLD’S FAIR.</h3>

<p>World’s fairs are special products of modern civilization,
and they present in a picturesque and dramatic way the essentials
of modern progress, liberty, intercourse between nations,
world-wide exchanges. The world’s fairs are for all the world,
and representatives of all nations, and the products of all nations
are gathered into them. These fairs are milestones of
progress; for all new arts and appliances of all lands are exhibited;
and they are social gatherings for civilized humanity.
If they had no other value than to reflect the unity of mankind
under modern liberty and Christianity, they would be
worth more than they cost. The spectacle of civilized mankind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and the products of their brain and hand collected
together in one place is in itself a lesson and an inspiration.
The world moves—toward concord, fraternity, unity.</p>

<p>The next world’s fair will have several new values. It is to
be held a long distance nearer to the equator than any of its
predecessors. It is to be at the mouth of one of the
world’s great streams, on the borders of the American Mediterranean,
in the midst of the tropical luxuriance of the South.
A world’s fair at New Orleans has all the qualities of a luxuriant
and inspiring prospective for the imagination. In a dozen
ways it invites enthusiasm. It is, for example, one of our reasons
for spending so freely our blood and treasure to keep the
mouth of the Mississippi within the United States of America;
one of the rewards of the South for its own failure to draw a
boundary line across that mighty stream. The nation which
held the city of New Orleans with a grip of iron, now spends
a million and a half to celebrate the concord of humanity in
that city. The nation will throng southward this winter, not
to secure its territorial integrity, but to celebrate its unity, and
the larger unity of mankind. Peace will have larger armies
than war had. We shall go in masses, because we want to see
our fair South, because it will cost each of us but little, to the
land we loved enough to die for, because a tropical world’s
fair has for us of the North a fascination which no other fair
ever had or ever will have. They are wise down there, and tell
us that the tropical display will be the leading feature of the
show. Of course it will, and it is that which will attract us and
pull us to the exhibition. We have all dreamed of the wealth
and magnificence of tropical verdure, and it is to be, so to say,
“on tap” in New Orleans next winter when our verdure is
asleep under the snow, or nestled at the roots of the trees in
saps which are mere possibilities of life next spring. “Tropical
display!” What other exhibition could have such a
charm?</p>

<p>Rumor says that the railways will astonish us by a schedule
of fares which will almost equalize riding and going on foot.
They are wise. They could afford to carry us for nothing.
Some time, and not a distant time, is to witness a great migration
southward. The railroads can richly afford to take us all
down there to see the great, rich, open field which has thus far invited
us in vain, while we have been following the westering
sun to the Pacific coast. Cheap lands, a climate and soil
favoring abundant production, undeveloped industrial opportunities,
and near markets, attract us, or would attract us, if we realized
them. A world’s fair at New Orleans affords the needed
incentive to a great movement of many classes of our people
to the South. Few of us know the country or its people. The
war and the turbulence of the reconstruction era, and political
disorders, on which we have no disposition to dwell, have made
us strangers and unsympathetic with each other as North and
South. The fair will disperse false notions and correct wrong
impressions in both sections. It will be a temple of concord
for the nation. We shall begin after this celebration of industry
to fill up the vacant lands and opportunities of the Gulf
region.</p>

<p>The details of the preparations are interesting. The grounds
are to be two hundred and twenty-seven acres of land on the
banks of the Mississippi. An electric railway is to encircle
them, and the spot is accessible both by land and water. The
buildings are five in number, and the main edifice is 1,378 feet
long and 905 feet wide without courts, and a glass roof, and so
arranged within as to afford an unobstructed view of the
whole of a magnificent hive of industry. Horticultural Hall
is the largest conservatory in the world, 600 feet long and 194
feet wide; and 20,000 plates of fruit, double the number ever
before displayed at once, will be shown on the tables. It stands
among live oak trees; it will be filled with tropical productions.
An infinite variety of southern trees and flowers will
be exhibited outside of this hall. Eminent horticulturists are
now engaged in arranging for our eyes a bewildering spectacle
of the verdure of the lands lying under the rich blessing of
the sun. Can New Orleans give shelter and food to all who
will visit the exhibition? The people think they can. It is a
city of 250,000 people, and from the inception of the enterprise
they have had committees at work upon this problem.
They are making a thorough canvass of the city for homes for
guests; charges will be fixed in advance and strictly supervised
throughout the exhibition. Let us all go to the New
Orleans World’s Fair.</p>

<h3>JUDICIOUS READING OF THE PERIODICAL PRESS.</h3>

<p>There is room for good judgment in everything, and daily
reading is no exception to the rule. It has come to pass that
periodical publications take up a large part of the time and
attention of readers, and the tendency in the case is for this
kind of printed page to draw too heavily upon us. Most persons
in towns read too much newspaper and too little book.
The newspapers are abundant, are good as newspapers, and
they are full of matter. They claim first attention because
they contain the news; they keep attention because the news
is abundantly padded, and because the newspaper furnishes
other attractive reading. Two or three bad effects of confining
ourselves to such reading must be experienced. One is that
a feverish interest in events of no great importance is created,
and our thoughts revolve about such events. Another bad
effect is that the knowledge of the newspaper devourer is imperfect,
scrappy, and mixed with errors of fact and principle.
The newspaper is produced in haste. Editors have no time to
verify all facts and sift out unsound opinions. It is a kind of
intellectual bar-room, where all sorts jostle each other and live
in good fellowship. The very copiousness and breadth of the
journal create a need of better and more accurate reading.
Its fragments need to be pieced together by wider knowledge
than it gives. It is not enough to say that the present reading
habits of our people give to the newspaper the first position as
a teacher of the people; one should go on to reflect that this
education is not by any means the best. It is too fragmentary
and disconnected. The tendency which we regret is not the
fault of the press, but it none the less requires the corrective
of some kind of restraint upon its habit of monopolizing so
large a portion of our time. One may easily learn to read the
paper swiftly, get its proper value in a few moments and pass
on. Information in more connected and complete forms invites
our attention to books; and an intelligent person should
save some time for these more valuable products of the press.
There is a place, in short, for good judgment in limiting the
intellectual tax which the newspaper levies upon us.</p>

<p>Good sense and sound discretion have a place also in our
selection of newspapers. They differ, not exactly as one star
differeth from another star in glory, but rather as a pure article
of merchandise differs from an adulterated article. A
clean press, in the general sense of the term, has almost become
the rule; but there are still many unclean papers. The
obviously unclean are easily shunned. Our danger comes
from periodicals conducted for particular ends, to gain which
the proprietors will on occasion sacrifice purity. A body of
ministers, the Cincinnati Conference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, has recently condemned in the strongest terms a
newspaper long honored for its purity, which has recently depreciated
the importance of personal chastity in public men.
The incident and its cause are a warning that newspapers
change their tone as they change editors, and that a strong
desire to promote some object may blind an editor and stain
the fairest page. There is but one remedy for this form of the
evil, and that is to cast out the newspaper which is guilty of
the offense. There is need of caution at this point, because a
favorite newspaper, like the king in absolutism, can do no
wrong. We grow accustomed to believing it right, to accepting
its teachings, to dropping all critical safeguards and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
for good and sound opinions whatever it may deliver to us.
This is not a safe habit. Editors like William Cullen Bryant
die and their successors may be of another spirit. Few newspapers
are the same in moral complexion for twenty years;
death and business changes inevitably alter them. Even our
favorite newspaper needs watching; and we ought never to
condone so gross an outrage on the sanctities of life as the one
to which we have reluctantly referred.</p>

<p>Another place for good judgment is in selecting the kind of
periodical literature we read. There is a great variety. Some
are too light; some are too heavy. Some are frivolous in
spirit and purpose; others are so solid that they weigh down
the eyelids of the reader. It is not necessary that good reading
should be dull, lifeless and soporific. On the other hand,
the periodicals which live upon love of fiction and curiosity
are too light for the use of people who are living on purpose
and for some proper ends. The popular magazine is too light.
It is, at best, like dress worn to be looked at rather than for
comfort and warmth. The ornamental has become too prominent
and too monopolizing. The readers of the popular periodical
add little to their wisdom and nothing to their aspirations.
Really good results from periodical reading must be
had in one of two ways or not at all. Wisdom or inspiration—or
both—should come to us from such reading. We are
stating the creed and the platform of <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span>. Its
special aims are these two: We wish to increase the knowledge
of our readers; we wish also to inspire them with two forms
of zeal, one which pursues wisdom, and another which aims
at sound and pure character. We believe that we help our
readers by giving them information and an appetite for it, and
that those who read <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> carefully are stimulated
by it to intellectual and moral effort. It has seemed to
us that the inspiring quality has disappeared from the average
monthly. Indeed, if we look for it in these days we must
search in periodicals which have a definite and pronounced
moral purpose. There is a pestilent theory that good literature
must have only an artistic purpose, that to be in bloody
earnest is not good form in letters. <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> is in
earnest; it is the organ of one of the most vigorous and aggressive
organizations for popular improvement, and its tone
and matter are fixed for it by the high purpose of that organized
crusade against ignorance and its consequences. We are not
content to please or to satisfy passing curiosity. The whim or
incident of the hour gets little of our attention. We are concerned
with permanent and useful things. We desire to enlarge
the horizon of our readers and fix their interest upon the
best and tested objects of living. We are confident that any
habitual reader of ours will be made wiser and better. There
is not much glitter about such results, and yet they will shine
when aimless literature has long ceased to glitter.</p>

<p>What is in a name? Isaac Newton recently committed
suicide in New York; Wilbur Fisk is traveling a circuit in Iowa;
George Washington was lately sent to prison in Georgia,
and Andrew Jackson has escaped from jail in Louisiana.
Any attentive newspaper reader can continue the list of
great names filling modest roles in contemporary history. Perhaps
it is a pity we have not names enough to go around.</p>

<p>The public lands of the West are being rapidly transferred
to private hands. During the year ended June 30th, last,
nearly twenty-seven millions of acres were disposed of. Of this
total, little more than seven millions were sold. More than
fourteen millions were given away as homesteads and timber
tracts; and the rest were given away, some 3,300,000 acres going
to railroad companies. The total is an increase of more
than eight millions over the previous year. And yet an abundance
of land remains in the hands of the government. It will
be a good while before we shall be crowded in this country.</p>

<p>At this writing it is difficult to predict the end of the troubles
in China. It is most probable that France will secure herself
in Tonquin. But a suspicion has existed for months that Bismarck
had a hand in this affair, and that he has secretly encouraged
France, hoping she would come to grief. It is now
rumored that he has intimated to the French that they have
gone far enough. Most political affairs in Europe are managed
by the Chancellor of the German empire, and he is probably
the only who can give a good guess at the result of the
French imbroglio in China.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Impure water supply is one of the greatest perils of our
great cities. Philadelphia and Chicago have old troubles.
Washington is more recently in trouble. There is only one thorough
remedy, and that is a system of sewage which transports
offal outside of the city and restores to the soil as much as
possible of the elements of our food. That gives a chance
for clean water, and it gives a chance for food for the next generation.
Chautauqua employs this system, and has pure wells
on the hillside and a pure lake at its feet.</p>

<p>It seems to us that more property has been burned up this
summer than is usual in the warm portion of the year. Insurance
agents say that accidental fires are much more common
in years of financial depression than in those of prosperity;
and they think out a moral connection between the two sets
of phenomena. Let us hope that the improvement in the
times will go on rapidly, else the winter may be one of unexampled
severity—for insurance companies.</p>

<p>A pleasant piece of statistic tells us that our people produce
forty-eight bushels of grain per capita, and consume forty-one
bushels per capita; and both these figures are the highest
in the world. We raise more grain and eat more food than
any other people. That test of prosperity is decisive. We
have our troubles, but let us “think on our mercies.”</p>

<p>Jerry McAuley, the evangelist of the slums, died last month.
There is refreshment in the man’s history. Born and trained
among the thieves of the worst quarter of New York, he got
into prison under a sentence for fifteen years, became a Christian
in prison, and spent the rest of his life reclaiming the fallen
men and women of his native city. Men <i>do</i> reform under
Christian forces, and a reformed man <i>may</i> do a glorious work.</p>

<p>Stolen marriages are not usually happy ones. In those
cases, especially where a well bred, liberally educated, and
luxuriously inclined girl elopes with a coachman or a deck
hand, the hasty espousals commonly end in misery for the
wife. Several such elopements have recently occurred; and
they seem to be “catching.” A Canadian girl of wealthy parentage
read the story of the Morosini elopement, and thereupon
got up an elopement of her own. The “catching” symptom
is probably due to the glories of the reporter’s rhetoric.</p>

<p>Dr. Woodrow is the last clergyman who has had fame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
thrust upon him, for a peculiarly unsuccessful attempt to become
an evolutionist. He first succeeded in getting Adam
evolved from an ape or something, and left Eve to be created.
More lately, he has, if we understand the story, evolutionized
the first human pair from a pair of apes by <i>an accidental variation</i>.
But there are no accidents in the genuine evolution;
and Dr. Woodrow is being made fun of from both sides.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The extraordinary liberality of the English Wesleyans has
attracted deserved attention and respect. They have collected
very large sums of money for new churches in London and for
missionary fields—millions of dollars in a few years. It is now
noted that the Scotch churches have been visited with refreshing
showers of the grace of giving. In one year the three branches
of Presbyterians have raised more than seven millions of dollars
for their own work. That sort of grace is proof of other
and more spiritual sorts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Young Men’s Christian Associations have grown marvelously.
Their New Year Book shows that on this continent
this child of yesterday has created $3,400,000 in Association
buildings, and put a great army of Christian workers into the
field. Its rapid growth and vigorous work are one of the marvels
of the time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is a notable lull in the storm against speculative and
religious philosophy. The reason is plain. The hope that we
should soon be able to see through creation and its cause with
a microscope has begun to expire, if it be not already dead.
This relegates science to its proper domain, and recalls reason
to her old office. Some abatement of scientific enthusiasm as
a speculative force is also to be noted. The British and American
Associations at Montreal and Philadelphia did not show
a puff of this sort of wind. Both attended strictly to scientific
business.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Attention has been called to the fact that people may live
too economically, by the havoc made by cholera among the
under-fed Italian peasants. Statesmen in Italy complain that
the rural peasants will save at the expense of vitality; in short,
starve themselves. In this country people do not fast or eat
insufficiently if they can get “square meals;” but they often
starve their souls.</p>

<p>“Gath” is out with a sound letter against beer guzzling.
“Boys,” he says, “were never seen in drinking places so long
as whiskey was the standard.” That is so. Everybody

sentimental argument that beer would cure drunkenness has
come to this issue.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is once more remarked that Jews are seldom victims of
cholera. In France, it is said, only seven Jews were this year
attacked by the disease. But perhaps this was a fair proportion
of Jews when we count them and the non-Jews and make
allowance for degrees of exposure to attack. It is not time yet
to condemn the hog to extermination on this branch of the
evidence.</p>

<p>There has been less than the usual supply of hazing barbarities
in the colleges this fall. Some tragical results in former
years have given the barbaric custom of outraging freshmen
serious blows. Here and there a case of hazing has attracted
attention this year. The evil has lost the prestige of
honored custom, and is now more honored in the breach than
in the observance. It will die without being regretted. Only
brutal creatures, unfit for decent society, engage in this form
of midnight violence.</p>

<p>Jean Robie, the Belgian flower painter, has a surprisingly
versatile genius. He is exceedingly able as a colorist, and his
flower-pieces have an enduring charm, but are so subtilely rendered
that their reproduction is extremely difficult. A very
successful effort has recently been made, by L. Prang &amp; Co.,
to reproduce one of his latest works by color printing on satin.
As a publication it is unique, and suitable either for an easel
picture, panel decoration, or for framing.</p>

<p>Good Chautauquans everywhere have a warm attachment to
the “Chautauqua Bells,” and will, we feel sure, unite with us in a
vote of sincere thanks to the McNeely Bell Co., of Troy, N.
Y., through whose courtesy, each summer, we hear the beautiful
chime on the point.</p>

<p>David Dudley Field renews the demand for a change of the
name of New York to Manhattan. It would be convenient, no
doubt; but the change is not practicable. Besides, New York
is already bigger than Manhattan Island, and Mr. Field wants
to take in Brooklyn. The effect of the enlargement of the
city is to make old Manhattan a section only of our American
metropolis, which, if it gets what belongs to it, Brooklyn and
Jersey City, will probably be the largest city on the globe in 1984.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Let no one twit the West any more on the subject of youth
and inexperience. Michigan, Ohio and Indiana have participated
in an earthquake—and earthquakes have chiefly favored
venerable countries. This earth-shiver, following closely upon
one on the Atlantic coast, confirms a scientific prophecy that
seismic disorders would have a revival over a wide field in these
years. Probably destructive earthquakes are not to be expected
to occur in new regions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A bad custom of gambling on the high seas, on the fashionable
steamers, has at last been called up for rebuke. The
evil has become intolerable to well-instructed people. The
present writer has heard more than one man boast that he
“made his passage money” by betting on cards during the
trip. Fast steamers are rapidly becoming gambling hells.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A fashionable woman went to Saratoga this summer with
twenty-one trunks containing ninety-three complete toilets.
She wore from two to five toilets a day, and left Saratoga the
day on which she had exhibited number ninety-three. This
species of fool dies hard, but she is dying, and the world
will by and by see the last of her. Respect for her decreases
steadily; in a few years she will be less interesting than the
shop window in which dresses are displayed on automata.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The United States Court in San Francisco has ruled that a
Chinese man and a Chinese woman, though ostensibly married,
are not one flesh. Judge Field said the country would
be flooded with Chinese if women could come in on the certificates
of their husbands. The decision relates to the right
of Chinamen to return after visiting their fatherland. The
golden gate is being gradually shut against these people; but
they are now coming in across the imaginary boundary line
between us and Canada. They can not be kept out. The
effort to prevent their coming is “love’s (?) labor lost.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We do not yet realize the greatness of this country. We
knew long ago that there is an iron mountain in Missouri.
Now we are told that there are four alum mountains in lower
California, containing one hundred millions of tons of alum.
Please do not invest in alum at present prices. “It may go
lower.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is reported that a movement for reform in the city government
of Chicago is ready to march. We suppose that the object
is to influence the elections next spring. Some excellent
results have followed these local organizations for good government.
Their success depends upon the energy and enthusiasm
with which they confine their work to home business.
When they mix national politics with local reform they go to
wreck. The excellent Brooklyn movement seems to have
been close to the rocks this summer, through dabbling in politics.
There ought to be no politics in administering the affairs of
a city, no more than in a bank or lumber yard.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>PREPARATORY GREEK COURSE IN ENGLISH.</h3>

<p>P. 95.—“Gorˈgi-as.” (B.C. 487-380.) A Greek rhetorician and
sophist. He captivated the Athenian populace by the splendor of his
eloquence, and had among his pupils Alcibiades and Æschines.</p>

<p>P. 97.—“Socrates.” The advice given by Socrates, who was very
fearful “lest it might be a matter of censure on the part of the state”
should Xenophon take part in this expedition, was that he should go to
Delphi and consult the oracle of the great god Apollo concerning the
undertaking.</p>

<p>P. 98.—“Pæˈan.” One of the names of Apollo; afterward transferred
from him to a triumphal song dedicated to him.</p>

<p>P. 100.—“Larissa.” Now Nimroud, and probably (with its excavated
palaces) the southern portion of the vast circuit of Nineveh,
“Resen” mentioned in Gen. 10-12.</p>

<p>P. 105.—“Brazen Utensils.” They very artfully forebore to molest
these, trying in every way possible to lead the Carduchians to look upon
them as friendly, so that they, the Greeks, might have a safe passage
through the country.</p>

<p>P. 108.—“Centrites.” Now called Bohtan Chai; eastern branch of
the Tigris.</p>

<p>Xenophon’s explanation: “For they,” his followers, “all knew that
any one might go to him at breakfast, or at dinner, or, if it should be
necessary, might rouse him up from sleep to say whatever one might
have to say concerning the war.”</p>

<p>P. 112.—“Părˈa-săng.” A Persian measure of length; about four
English miles.</p>

<p>P. 115.—The Armenians lived in underground houses then, as they
do now, on account of the excessive cold of the winters. The great
elevation of the uplands explains the extreme severity of the cold.</p>

<p>P. 119.—“Golden Fleece.” The Argonauts were the earliest heroes
of Greek antiquity; they were the first to navigate unknown and dangerous
seas. The story is as follows: Jason was ordered by his uncle
Pelias, of Thessaly, to bring him the golden fleece of a ram which was
nailed to an oak in the grove of Mars, in Colchis, and which was
watched by a sleepless dragon. After a voyage full of adventures he
and his followers reached the goal of their expedition. Æëtes, king
of the country, promised the fleece to Jason on condition that he would
perform some difficult and dangerous tasks. Medea, the king’s daughter,
fell in love with Jason, and taught him how to overcome the dangers
and seize the fleece. Then she fled with him back to Iolcus.</p>

<p>P. 120.—“Pancratium,” pan-crāˈshĭ-um. An athletic contest which
combined boxing and wrestling.</p>

<p>P. 121.—“Ulysses.” A Greek hero of the Trojan war. For account
of his arrival, “outstretched and asleep,” see “Preparatory Greek
Course in English,” page 222, the fifth stanza from the end.</p>

<p>“Cerasus.” Whence our word <i>cherry</i>, which fruit was brought from
this region into Italy by Lucullus in 73 B. C.</p>

<p>“Mosynœci.” A people celebrated for their warlike spirit and savage
customs. Their houses were built of wood and were of conical
form. Their government was very curious; a king chosen by them was
strictly guarded in a house higher than the rest, and was maintained at
public cost; but as soon as he displeased the people they starved him to
death.</p>

<p>P. 128.—“Atrides,” a-triˈdes. The name signifies <i>son</i> or <i>descendant</i>
of <i>Atreus</i>, and was bestowed especially upon Agamemnon and Menelaus.
Agamemnon is referred to here.</p>

<p>“Keats.” (1795-1821.) An English poet. His chief works were
“Endymion,” “Eve of St. Agnes,” and “Hyperion.” He died in
Rome.</p>

<p>P. 129.—“Thetis.” The wife of Pelé-us, and mother of Achilles.
She dwelt in the depths of the sea, and had the power of assuming any
form she pleased. All the gods were invited to be present on the occasion
of her marriage to Peleus, except Discord, who avenged herself by
throwing into the assembly the apple which was the source of so much
misery. Thetis foretold Achilles that his fate was either to gain glory and
die early, or to live a long and inglorious life. The hero chose the former,
and took part in the Trojan War, from which he knew he was not
to return.</p>

<p>“Derby.” (1799-1869.) A distinguished English statesman; for
several years a member of Parliament, and among the first and most eloquent
orators of the time; was elected Chancellor of Oxford on the
death of the Duke of Wellington, and was made Premier after Lord
Palmerston. “His version of the ‘Iliad,’” says the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
“is far more allied to the original, and superior to any that has yet been
attempted in the blank verse of our language.”</p>

<p>P. 132.—“Newman.” An English author, born 1805. He was a
great traveler, and wrote many works on historical, political, and theological
subjects. He was a brother of John Henry Newman, who was
converted to Roman Catholic doctrines.</p>

<p>“Worsley.” See “Preparatory Greek Course in English,” page 203.</p>

<p>“Ipsissimus.” His very own self. A strengthened form of the Latin
pronoun <i>ipse</i>, meaning <i>himself</i>.</p>

<p>P. 134.—“Quære.” From the Latin word <i>quæ-ro</i>, meaning <i>to question</i>;
whence our word <i>query</i>.</p>

<p>P. 136.—“Macedonia’s Madman.” A title given to Alexander the
Great, so called because of his fiery, impetuous character.</p>

<p>P. 142.—“Empyrean,” ĕm-py-rēˈan. The highest heaven.</p>

<p>P. 144.—“Ajax.” One of the great chiefs of the Trojan War, second
only to Achilles in martial powers. There was another of the same
name, and the two were distinguished by adding the words <i>greater</i> or
<i>lesser</i> after their names.</p>

<p>“Pelides.” Son of Peleus; Achilles.</p>

<p>“Phthiˈa.” The city in which Achilles resided, situated in the southeastern
part of Thessaly. Thessaly now forms part of the Turkish
province of Salonika.</p>

<p>P. 147.—“By this sacred scepter.” As the oath was a renunciation
of service to Agamemnon, the general-in-chief, Achilles very naturally
swears by his scepter, which was the emblem of regal power.</p>

<p>P. 148.—“Centaurs.” A race said to have lived on Mt. Pelion, in Thessaly.
They were represented as half horses and half men, perhaps from the
fact that hunting on horseback was a national custom. From this very
easily the fable might have arisen, just as the Americans, when they first
saw a Spaniard on horseback, thought horse and man to be one being.</p>

<p>P. 150.—“Ambrosial.” Divine, immortal.</p>

<p>“Here,” heˈre or heˈra. Juno.</p>

<p>P. 160.—“Achaians.” One of the chief Greek races. As they were
the ruling nation in the heroic times, Homer frequently calls the collective
Greeks by their name.</p>

<p>“Danaäns.” Another name applied to the Greeks. It was derived
from Danaus, one of the earliest settlers in Greece.</p>

<p>P. 161.—“Neologism,” ne-ŏlˈo-gism. The introduction of new
words.</p>

<p>P. 164.—“Tydides,” ty-dīˈdes. Son of Tydeus, Diomed.</p>

<p>P. 165.—“Son of Capaneus.” Sthenelus, commander of the Greeks
under Diomed, and one of those who afterward were concealed in the
wooden horse.</p>

<p>“Well-greaved.” Greaves were armor for the legs, a sort of heavy boots.</p>

<p>P. 166.—“Iris.” The messenger of the gods. She traveled on the
rainbow.</p>

<p>P. 167.—“Ichor,” īˈkor. An ethereal fluid that supplied the place of
the blood in the veins of the gods.</p>

<p>“Pergamus.” The citadel of Troy.</p>

<p>P. 170.—“Simoïs and Scamander,” simˈo-is, sca-manˈder. Rivers of
Troy. “Simoïs,” also name of the river god. The Scamander was
sometimes called <i>Xanthus</i>.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE ART OF SPEECH.</h3>

<p>P. 11.—“Leibnitz,” fon līpˈnĭts. (1646-1716.) Preëminent as a philosopher
and mathematician. In his papers on “Language” he advanced
theories which place him among linguists in the same position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which Hallam considers him to hold among geologists, when he says:
“Of all the early geologists, or indeed of all down to a time not very
remote, Leibnitz came nearest to the theories which are most received
in the English school at this day.”</p>

these scholars have contributed to the science of philology; Hălˈhed
(1751-1830), an English author, prepared a “Grammar of the Bengal
Language;” “Jones” (1764-1794), of whom it has been said that in

translated much and wrote a Sanskrit grammar; “Schlegel,” schlāˈgel
(1767-1845) is said to be the first German who mastered Sanskrit, on
which he wrote much; “Bopp” (1791-1867) founded the science of
comparative philology. His greatest work was a “Comparative Grammar
of the Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian, Old Sclavonian,
Gothic and German languages.” This work was translated into English
by Prof. Wilson (1786-1860), who, while a surgeon in Bengal, had
learned Sanskrit. Returning to England, he was made professor of
Sanskrit at Oxford; “Grimm” (1785-1863), the great German philologist
furthered the study by the discovery of the law by which words
change their forms; “Weber” (1825-⸺), a pupil of Bopp’s, contributed
a large number of translations and papers on oriental lore; “Kuhn,”
kōōn (1812-⸺), also Bopp’s pupil, is called the founder of comparative

on the classification of languages, primitive speech, the development
of speech, and similar subjects; “Eichhoff,” āˈkofˌ (1799-⸺),
a Frenchman, wrote a “Comparison of the Languages of Europe with
those of India;” “Renan,” reh-nonˈ (1823-⸺), the French critic and

on the “Origin of Languages;” “Chavée,” shäˌvāˈ (1815-1877), a
Belgian, has attempted to disprove the unity of the human race, in an
“Essay on the Knowledge of Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, French and Russian
Words;” “Müller,” müˈler (1823-⸺), the present German-English
authority on language, has written several volumes, and Prof.

<p>P. 31.—“Heyse,” hēˈzeh. (1797-1855.) An able German scholar who
wrote a valuable work on philology.</p>

<p>P. 33.—“Bleek,” (1827-1875.) He spent many years in Africa,

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>THE BONDS OF SPEECH.</h3>

<p>P. 63, c. 1.—“Basques,” bask. The inhabitants of three Spanish
provinces on the slopes of the Pyrenees. The government, customs and
language of these people are peculiar and interesting. In government
they are nearly republican. “Each province is governed by a parliament
composed of representatives selected partly by election, partly by
lot, among the householders of each county parish or town. A deputation,
named by the parliament, insures the strict observance of the special
laws and customs of the province, and negotiates with the representative
of the Spanish crown. Delegates from the three parliaments
meet annually to consider the common interests of the provinces; they
employ a seal representing three interlaced hands, with the motto, ‘The
three are one,’ but no written federal pact exists.” In their habits the
people are very simple; agriculture is the principal occupation. They
live on very equal terms, the class of nobles being small. The language was
not written earlier than the fifteenth century. It is said to present some
grammatical resemblance to the North American and certain East
African languages.</p>

<p>P. 64, c. 1.—“Frisian,” frishˈe-ans. A Germanic people inhabiting
at present the eastern coast of Holland, the fens of Saterland, the western
shore of Schleswig, and a few adjacent islands. There exists now
but a remnant of the ancient Frisians.</p>

<p>P. 66, c. 1.—“Cimmerian,” cim-mēˈri-an. An adjective derived from
the Cimmerii, a mythical people represented by Homer as inhabiting a
remote region of mist and darkness. Later writers locate this country
near Lake Avernus, a lake of Italy about eight miles from Naples, or in
the Crimea, or in Spain. “Their country was fabled to be so gloomy
that the expression ‘Cimmerian darkness’ became proverbial; and
Homer, according to Plutarch, drew his images of hell and Pluto from
the dismal region they inhabited.”</p>

<p>“Comanches,” co-manˈches; “Piutes,” pi-utesˈ. Tribes of American
Indians belonging to the Shoshone family. Only remnants of them
now remain. The Piutes are one of the numerous divisions of the
Utahs or Utes.</p>

<p>P. 67, c. 1.—“Primum Mobile.” The prime mover; first power;
the beginning.</p>

<p>“Eddic.” Found in the Edda, the sacred books of the old Scandinavian
tribes. These books contain almost all that we know of the
mythology of the Northmen.</p>

<p>The original signification of “Edda” is “great-grandmother.” It is
properly applied to but one collection, the other being a misnomer. The
true Edda, or <i>Younger Edda</i>, is a prose collection, giving a history of
the world and the gods. The <i>Elder Edda</i> is a collection of poems,
dating from the eighth or ninth centuries. Many of them are only
fragments. They treat of mythical and religious legends of an early
Scandinavian civilization, and are composed in the simplest and most
archaic form of Icelandic verse.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>HOME STUDIES IN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS.</h3>

<p>P. 68, c. 2.—“Antiparos,” an-tipˈa-ros. A small island of the Grecian
Archipelago. The grotto is its chief feature of interest. “It consists
of an immense marble arch, the roof, sides and center of which are
covered with stalactites and dazzling crystallizations, assuming the shapes
of columns, screens, flowers, trees, etc. The stalactites hanging from
the roof unite in several places with stalagmites rising from the floor, so
that the arch is apparently supported by a continuous series of pillars.
The grotto is entered by a natural arch of rugged rock, overhung with
trailing plants.”</p>

<p>“Caverns.” To the caverns mentioned here must be added the
“Fish River Caves” near Sydney, Australia. A writer in a late issue
of the <i>Scientific American</i> thus describes them: “These caves are situated
about eighty miles west of Sydney, Australia, and are some 3,000
feet above sea level, in an interesting mountainous locality. They were
first discovered by a party of settlers in 1866, while in pursuit of bush-rangers.
They are singularly attractive. The intricate galleries, halls,
and passages in their subterranean scenes are so magnificent that a person
having once seen them is desirous of viewing them again and again,
new features being presented to his view at each visit and at every turn.
The strange forms that have been assumed by the drippings from the
limestone are almost infinite, and are in beauty unsurpassable in their
own character elsewhere. When lighted up by the incandescent magnesium
wire or other strong light, these sublime chambers, so strangely
formed by nature’s hands, present a gorgeous spectacle, filled as they
are with drooping sprays, coral growths, delicate pendants, gigantic
columns, handsome shawls, huge curtains, and shadowy arches of the
most fantastic kind.”</p>

<p>“Church,” F. E. (1826-⸺.) An eminent American landscape
painter. His earliest pictures of note were scenes from the Catskills.
Among his later productions are “Under Niagara,” “The Heart of the
Andes,” “Cotopaxi,” and “Sunrise on Mount Desert Island.” “The
Icebergs” is ranked among his best works.</p>

<p>P. 69, c. 2.—“Mer-de-Glace,” mer-deh-gläs. Sea of ice. A glacier

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>SUNDAY READINGS.</h3>

<p>P. 71, c. 1.—“Payson,” Edward. (1783-1827.) An American clergyman
of the Congregational Church, Portland, Me., and the author of
several works.</p>

<p>“Cowper,” William. (1731-1800.) A celebrated English poet. He
was subject to attacks of insanity, and fancied himself destined to eternal
woe.</p>

<p>“Tennents,” Gilbert and William. Two American clergymen of the
Presbyterian Church, who lived during the first part of the eighteenth
century. William was at one time seriously ill, and remained for several
days in a condition of apparent death. His account of his emotions was,
that at the moment of his seeming death he found himself surrounded
by an unutterable glory, and saw a great multitude in the height of bliss;
and that when he was about to join the happy throng some one came to
him and said: “You must go back.” When he found himself in the
world again he fainted. For three years the recollection of what he
had seen and heard was so intense as to make earthly things seem worthless.</p>

<p>“Edwards,” Jonathan. (1703-1758.) An American divine and metaphysician,
the greatest theologian of his century. Dr. Chalmers, of
Scotland, said of him: “On the arena of metaphysics he stood the highest
of all his contemporaries.” This American divine affords, perhaps,
the most wondrous example in modern times of one who stood gifted
both in natural and spiritual discernment.</p>

<p>P. 72, c. 1.—“Spurgeon,” Charles H. (spurˈjon). The great English
preacher, born 1834. In 1854 he was called to the new Park
Street Baptist Chapel in Southwark, London; and his preaching soon
drew such crowds that the congregation removed first to Exeter Hall,
and then to Surrey Music Hall, the largest public room in London. In
1861 a new chapel of great size was completed for his congregation.
For several years he has preached an average of nearly a sermon a day,
traveled extensively, and written several books.</p>

<p>P. 72, c. 2.—“Martineau,” marˌtēˌnoˈ. An English Unitarian clergyman,
born about 1805. Author of several theological works.</p>

<p>P. 73, c. 2.—“Fuller,” Thomas. (1608-1661.) An English divine,
court chaplain to Charles I. and II.</p>

<h3>GLIMPSES OF ANCIENT GREEK LIFE.</h3>

<p>P. 73, c. 2.—“Leotychides,” leˌo-tīkˈi-dēs.</p>

<p>“Aristocracies.” For account of the freedom of early Athens from
anything like aristocracy, see “Brief History of Greece,” pp. 46 and
47.</p>

<p>P. 74, c. 1.—House decorations. The dwelling houses of the Greeks
were small and insignificant, so that their skill in architecture would
show to better advantage on their public buildings. In the time of Pericles
they were forbidden by law to build fine houses or to have a display
of any kind about them. See “Brief History of Greece,” p.
84, note. Alcibiades began to indulge his love of beauty by home decoration;
and for a description of a Greek house in later times see “Brief
History of Greece,” p. 83.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thasos.” All traces of its ancient gold mines which yielded such
large revenues have entirely disappeared. When Xerxes marched
through Thrace, the Thasians, on account of their great wealth, and
possessions on the mainland, were compelled to provide for the Persian
army as it passed through their territories, and their expenditure was
four hundred talents, about $460,000. Some remains of the ancient
city still exist.</p>

<p>P. 74, c. 2.—“Demes,” dēˈmēs. Originally the Athenians were divided,
according to their places of residence, into a number of boroughs
or wards, demes.</p>

<p>“Coutts.” (1731-1822.) The wealth of this great banker was estimated
at between two and three millions sterling. It finally reverted to
his granddaughter, Miss Frances Burdett, on condition she would assume
the name of Coutts. By her this wealth was dispensed freely in
various charities.</p>

<p>P. 75, c. 1.—“Talent.” A talent is about $1,180.</p>

<p>“Bucephalus,” bu-sephˈa-lus. See “Cyrus and Alexander.”</p>

<p>“Orchomenus,” or-komˈe-nus.</p>

<p>P. 75, c. 2.—“Châlets,” shä-lāˈ. Mountain huts, in which the herdsmen
live. They are low and flat, and are covered with stones to protect
them against the elements. The interior has scarcely anything beyond
the apparatus of the dairy. In the loft above is a store of straw for
beds. All the Swiss valleys are covered with huts of this kind. Each
herdsman has to collect about a hundred cows twice a day, and make
cheese, which is the principal occupation inside the abodes. The owners
of the cattle sometimes reside also in châlets, but they are of a
superior kind, and frequently offer a delightful retreat to weary travelers.</p>

<p>“Bees.” Hybla, in Megaris, and Mt. Hymettus, in Attica, were celebrated
far and near on account of the honey produced there.</p>

<hr class="shorter" />

<h3>GREEK MYTHOLOGY.</h3>

Agamemnon, on his return from Troy, was murdered by Ægisthus and
Clytemnestra. Orestes avenged his father’s death by killing his mother
and her guilty partner, for which he was pursued by the Furies.</p>

<p>“Orpheus.” One of the Argonauts. He enchanted with his music
act only the wild beasts, but the trees and rocks, so that they followed the
sound of his golden harp. He went after his lost wife, Proserpine, into the
abodes of Hades, and suspended the torments of the lost, by his music.
He won his wife back from the most inexorable of all deities, but had
promised not to look back at her till they had arrived in the upper world.
The anxiety of love overcame him, and he looked round to see that she
was surely following. At that moment she was caught back to the infernal
region.</p>

<h2 id="THE_CHAUTAUQUA_UNIVERSITY">THE CHAUTAUQUA UNIVERSITY.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Work has begun in the Chautauqua University. Courses of
study in several departments have been prepared. Some students
have been enrolled. Large numbers of letters of inquiry
are being daily received, and the outlook is brilliant for
a work far in advance of anything which the projectors of the
enterprise had hoped. A lovely spot at Chautauqua, on the
north side of the grounds, toward Mayville, has been selected
as the center of the University. It will be inclosed and beautified.
Within it will be the University offices, and colonnades,
and halls accessible to those of our members who shall be
able to visit Chautauqua in July and August. It will be known
as “The Academia.”</p>

<p>The professors who have been appointed are for the most
part men whose reputation as successful and experienced
teachers is firmly established, and who will bring to this new
work the same enthusiasm which has characterized them in
other fields. Circulars containing full information concerning
the aims of the University, the courses already prepared, the
departments to be organized, the requirements for specific degrees,
and the estimated cost of the course, may be obtained
by addressing the Registrar, R. S. Holmes, at the central office
in Plainfield, N. J. <span class="smcap">The Chautauquan</span> for October announced
our purposes and general plan. We now present
some of the prominent and distinguishing features of our work:</p>

<p>1. The Chautauqua University is the only institution of the
kind in the world. It stands alone. True, there are some
other circles which, by correspondence, have pursued special
and limited courses upon some particular subject; but ours is
the only school whose avowed object is to conduct its students
over the whole field of liberal learning, and reward them at
their journey’s close, with a well earned degree. To all, who
as pioneers in the field of education by correspondence, have
helped to demonstrate the feasibility of organized effort in this
direction, the Chautauqua University pays willing tribute.
Their success gives footing to our confidence. If history can
be so taught, why not philosophy, or logic, or literature, or any
kindred topic? If Hebrew can be so taught, why not any ancient
language? If French can be so taught, why not any
modern language? True, we lack the presence of the living
teacher, but the chief value of the teacher’s presence is to test
the accomplished work of the student, and to prompt by word
and hint to better work in lines of which the student had not
thought. Both of these <i>can be accomplished</i> by our method.
The one condition is <i>work—earnest, persistent work</i>.</p>

<p>Teaching by correspondence is like conversation by telephone.
We may never see each other, yet speak as face to
face. We are miles apart, maybe, yet answer voice to voice.
We are far without the range of possible personal contact, yet
more in immediate obedience to each other’s will. So with
teacher and pupil, they are mutually unseen; yet teacher’s letter
on pupil’s table, and pupil’s letter on teacher’s table are a
visible presentation of each to the other. They are widely
separate; yet by correspondence question and answer are interchanged
in rapid succession. Their paths of life never converge;
yet teacher and pupil move mutually in daily lines
which want and its supply make necessary.</p>

<p>As the soldier may fight battles and win victories under the
direction of a general whom he has never seen, so the student
may win in fields of learning without once seeing his teacher’s
guiding hand.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Chautauqua University makes no limitation in the
time allowed to students, to complete her prescribed courses.</i>
Our students are not limited by time. They are not actuated
by the spirit which hurries young men through college, seminary,
and professional school, that at the earliest possible moment
they may reach their chosen field of labor. Many of
our students have reached their life work. They are on farms,
in shops and stores, in factories and foundries, in press-room
and in pulpit, in counting-room and court house, at home and
by the way. They thirst for knowledge; to them we open the
fountain. Their leisure time they would use in making reparation
for lost opportunities of earlier years; or in supplementing
the moderate acquirement which those earlier years had
given. We offer them wise direction in this work, and say, Use
the leisure that you have—make moments even at the cost of
sacrifice; learn how to double moments by the quality of the
work you crowd into them; choose from our courses of study
those which you can pursue, and then pursue them till you
reach the reward which we offer for their satisfactory completion.
Do it; in four years, or six years if you can; in eight
years, or ten years if you must, but do it; let nothing turn you
from your purpose—after the struggle comes the victory, and
the fruit of that victory will be not only the knowledge which
you crave, but what is far better, <i>power over self, and the
habit of self use</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Chautauqua University does not require one who is
enrolled as a student to take a complete course of study before
giving official recognition to work already accomplished.</i> It is
not possible for persons circumstanced as our students will be
to devote so much of time each day to study that they can do
the whole work of a college course in the ordinary four years.
It may be that after a year or two of study, and the completion
of some one department course, interruptions may arise
which will disarrange a student’s plans and thwart for the
time his purpose. To such students we promise to give official
recognition. Should the work pursued be that of a single
department, of several, or of all, much or little, for each finished
branch of study the student will receive an official certificate
signed by the professor with whom he has studied, and
by the Chancellor and Registrar of the University; and whenever
any student shall have obtained certificates, representing
all the departments which are essential to the obtaining of any
specified degree, the presentation of these certificates to the
Board of Trustees will entitle their owner to the degree without
further examination. In this there is no purpose of lowering
the standard of requirement or of making an easy road to a
degree. Certificates will represent rigid, searching and thorough
examinations. We are not aware that such a course is
pursued by any other institution. The student who is compelled
to leave his college course unfinished leaves behind him
on the books of the institution his record, but bears with him
no official certificate of that record.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Chautauqua University takes the student where it
finds him.</i> This makes education possible for the classes of
society for which this enterprise is begun. Absence from home
becomes unnecessary. We bid no man leave other duties
undone, in order to study. We shorten no business hours;
we shut no office doors; we turn no key upon the wants of a
busy world. But when days are rainy and trade is dull, when
the harvest is ended and the fences are mended, the winter’s fuel
gathered and the farm implements are all repaired, when the
shut-down of dull times comes in the factory, when household
work is over, when evening comes, then are we ever at hand
to whisper, give us your hours, and turn your backs upon the
amusements, the frivolities, the wastefulnesses of the world.
We ask no father or mother to toil and save that one from the
home fireside may have the benefits of college education.
We say to all, pursue together the paths we mark out for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
We increase no household expenses by the evening and
morning hour’s study which we require. The small comparative
outlay of money our courses make necessary will be repaid
in ennobled character, and in more comprehensive views
of life. We lay our text-books on the anvil, and some day we
shall see Elihu Burritt or Robert Collyer emerging from the
smoke and grime of the shop. We will place a law book by
the cobbler’s side, and ever and anon he casts his eye at the
open page; and by and by the cobbler’s sign is down and
the shop is deserted—but an eloquent voice is pleading at the
bar the claims of justice and humanity.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Chautauqua University comes into competition with
no other institution.</i> We do not want as students those who
can go to college. We do not wish to influence any one to
neglect college opportunities freely offered. We expect that
the work of the Chautauqua University will be to arouse so
much interest in the subject of general liberal education that
by and by in all quarters young men and women will be
seeking means to obtain such education in established resident
institutions. We expect to see the cause of education
receive an impetus which it has had from no other source in
the last quarter of a century. Meanwhile, we appeal to the
classes already mentioned in our first article. “Worthy young
people not able to go to college;” “those who, having begun a
college course, have been compelled to abandon it by circumstances
beyond their control;” and those “more mature men
and women who, at the maximum of their mental power, desire to
make amends for the educational omissions of the earlier years.”</p>

<p>In touching upon these several points we have to some extent
repeated ideas already advanced in our general announcement.
This was necessary in order to give prominence to
these aspects of our scheme which seem to be worthy of emphatic
public notice, and also to serve the purpose of making
general answer to questions being asked in numbers too great
to admit of personal answer. With a single word we close.
October has come and well nigh gone, but let no one by that
consideration be debarred from entering upon our course of
study. Our doors are always open. It is better to begin with
the year. But it is better to begin now than not at all. Our
professors will gladly welcome as pupils any who are actuated
by an earnest desire to enter the realms of the liberal arts, and
in their names it is our pleasure to urge upon you careful consideration
of the purposes and possibilities of the Chautauqua
University.</p>

<h2 id="TALK_ABOUT_BOOKS">TALK ABOUT BOOKS.</h2>

<hr class="shorter" />

<p>Bishop Foster is a vigorous writer, always clear and forcible. His last
work, “Centenary Thoughts for the Pew and the Pulpit,”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> will be
regarded as one of his best productions; a book for the times, but containing
much of permanent value. It evidently was not manufactured, but
grew. The thought or germ took root in generous soil, and the growth
was rapid. The volume is instructive, and must do good to the thousands
who will be eager to read it. It was prepared specially for the
members of the great Christian brotherhood known as Methodists, but
will interest others, and lead to a better understanding of both the privileges
and duties of Church membership. Its appeals are forcible, but
made in great kindness. If there are sharp rebukes for delinquents and
offenders, they are given with manifest tenderness, and in the spirit of
love unfeigned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The “Dictionary of Miracles,”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> a unique and unpretentious volume
of nearly six hundred pages, is a classified collection of legendary miracles
and stories of saints taken from authentic sources. Dr. Brewer is
a ripe scholar, in the fiftieth, or golden year of his authorship, and has
earned his laurels. These extracts are made with great fairness, the author
expressing no opinion as to the historic truth of the reported miracles,
but presenting them in a compact form as evidence of the religious
opinions of those among whom they are current.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To all who have been readers of <i>The Sunday-School Times</i> a book
written by the editor needs no words of recommendation in order to secure
it a welcome. All workers in the Sunday-school will find this
book to be a helper and a friend. It is full of good, practical thoughts
and plans on the work, and clearly brings before the mind what teaching
really is, and the relation that a teacher should bear to his class.
We make a short extract: “It takes two persons to make one teacher.
<i>You</i> can be one of them; the other must be a <i>learner</i>.” “Teaching
and Teachers”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> is a book every teacher should have.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A very neat little book, which curiosity hunters will enjoy, comes
bearing the title “Curious Epitaphs.”<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a> Epitaphs on all sorts of persons;
epitaphs containing puns and warnings, and miscellaneous epitaphs
of all kinds are to be found in its pages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Joseph Cook and his Boston lectures are too well known to need comment.
All who are interested in following the “advanced thought” of
this remarkable man will require his “Occident.”<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a> This valuable
book contains Mr. Cook’s lectures on “advanced thought” in England,
Germany, Italy and Greece; his remarkable expositions of Professor
Zöllner’s views of spiritualism, and the views of his opponents; the discussion
on probation after death, and many talks on current topics of the
time. It contains decidedly the most interesting collection of lectures
published this season.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A work on physiology and hygiene, eminently practical, and showing
the most approved methods of the school room, has just been published
by A. Lovell &amp; Co.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a> For primary and intermediate grades it is decidedly
the best work we have seen. The object lessons, given or suggested,
will be valuable aids to teachers, and for all young readers the principal
facts are well expressed, and amply illustrated. Though a book for
children it is not childish, and any one may gather from it lessons of
great value. The chapters on alcohol and narcotics furnish the basis of
lessons that should be taught plainly in all our schools.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Anatomy, Physiology, and Hygiene”<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a> is a work evidently prepared
by one having a thorough knowledge of the subject. Though scientific
and scholarly, it is popular in style, and not burdened with useless technicalities.
It is well illustrated. The great advance made in physiological
and hygienic knowledge in the last decade is noted with no ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
satisfaction. The millions who now know so much of themselves,
their needs and resources, liabilities and safeguards, are congratulated.
Such knowledge and obedience to nature’s laws connect closely with the
progress of society, and all that is most valuable in human achievement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A little volume of poems by Andrew Lang bears the title, “Ballades
and Verses Vain.”<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> The poems are classified into five different groups.
There are ballads on all sorts of subjects and charming society verses,
a handful of sonnets and a collection of bright translations, beside a
few songs, “Post Homerica.” Austin Dobson has written these pretty
verses of introduction for Mr. Lang’s “Laughter and Song:”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Laughter and song the poet brings,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And lends them form and gives them wings;</div>
<div class="verse i1">Then sets his chirping squadron free</div>
<div class="verse i1">To post at will by land or sea,</div>
<div class="verse i1">And find their home, if that may be.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Laughter and song this poet, too,</div>
<div class="verse i1">A Western brother sends to you;</div>
<div class="verse i1">With doubtful flight the darting train</div>
<div class="verse i1">Have crossed the bleak Atlantic main—</div>
<div class="verse i1">Now warm them in your hearts again.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Visitors so bright and so pleasantly introduced will not want warm
hearts to greet them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A treat awaits all the little folks who can be made the happy possessors
of “Queer Stories for Boys and Girls.”<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> There may be found fairy
stories and stories of real folks; stories of good children and those of
bad children—and somehow the bad ones always “get the worst of it,”
just as they ought to do. Then those stories told by the “Cellar Door
Club!” They are enough to make any boy want to go right out and
start a club like that in his own neighborhood. Parents would do well
to see that their children are provided with these Queer Stories. They
will help to cultivate in them such a love for the true and the good as to
lead them to shun frivolous literature.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The striking originality displayed in “The King’s Men”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a> must secure
for the book a wide reading. The scene is laid in the twentieth
century, and the present times are alluded to as the days of old. The
pitiable attempt at keeping up the show of royalty in his narrow quarters
in America, on the part of England’s exiled king, George V., the grandson
of the present Prince of Wales, is well depicted. The struggle of
the young English republic, and the sympathy and aid given it by its
elder sister, America, are as real as if true. A capital hit is made in
the employment he finds for the poor British aristocracy. These remnants
of “better days,” in order to obtain a livelihood, let themselves
out to a sort of caterer. This personage uses them as guests at the entertainments
of the new families in the rising republic, who wish to hire
titles to give them prestige in society.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What is to be done with the negro factor in our nation is a question
over which the minds of our statesmen have been long interested.
Judge Tourgée now comes to the front, and very vividly, and in the
earnest manner so characteristic of the man, shows the dangers threatening
in the not far distant future. To avert these action, prompt and
specific, is necessary now. What, in the estimation of the Judge, this
action should be he sets forth in his “Appeal to Cæsar.”<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> This appeal
is forcible and logical. His Cæsar, the great American People, it is to
be hoped, will not turn a deaf ear to it. This appeal to his Cæsar is a
serious book. It is not fiction—nor plain truth clothed in fiction—it is
the honest conviction of an earnest, far-seeing man, told plainly and
with ringing effect. “The color line,” the author claims, “which
before marked only the distinction of caste, has now become the line of
demarkation between hostile forces. Out of the ‘irrepressible conflict’
between freedom and slavery has grown one of far graver portent to the
nation and the world. Must one of these forces overthrow, subjugate,
and forever hold in subjection the other? Or is it possible that the two
races live peacefully side by side, and equality of right and power be
cheerfully accorded to all?” The author believes this may be done,
but that it must be done quickly. For us it is to act. And how? By
educating our freedman. A national appropriation is pleaded for as the
only sure way of avoiding the ills which threaten the Union from the
South. It is not croaking to talk plainly on an evil, or the possibility of
an evil. The book on the contrary is manly and forcible, and deserves
careful attention.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A good feature of “young American” literature is its biography.
Many of the short papers which appear in the periodical press are remarkably
strong. Such certainly are the articles by James Parton which
for some time have been appearing in leading papers, and which have
lately been gathered into book form under the title, “Captains of Industry.”<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>
The strongest feature of this collection is the freshness of the
material. A few of the models which we hold before our boys have become
not a little threadbare. They no longer arouse much enthusiasm.
Here is a book full of new heroes who have done not impossible things
like becoming the father of one’s country, or inventing a steam engine,
or discovering America, but have done deeds which are, or at least seem,
practical. Here is the history of Frederick Tudor, the Boston ice exporter,
with a capital story of the appreciations which East Indians have
for the man who gave them the blessing of ice; of Chauncey Jerome, the
Yankee clock maker; of Carême, the famous French cook, and of over
forty more, most of them equally new. Material so good deserves thorough
treatment. It has not had such in this volume. The newspaper
mark lingers on the work. The literary finish of the book is not equal
to the spirit with which it was evidently written, nor to the amount of
labor which must have been expended in collecting these valuable and
entertaining facts and anecdotes. The book is so good that this is to be
regretted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There has never been a satisfactory explanation advanced by geologists
of the origin of what is called “the Drift” period of the earth’s
history. One theory attributes it to the action of great waves, but “the
Drift” contains no fossils; another to icebergs, but the heaviest rocks
are not found on top, and there is no regular stratification of material.
All theories have been more or less incomplete. The author of that
strange book “Atlantis,” has in “Ragnarok”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> found a new explanation.
The name itself explains his theory. It is derived from an old Scandinavian
legend, and means “the rain of dust.” “The Drift” is nothing,
our author holds, and argues with great ingenuity, but the dust scattered
by a comet which struck the earth ages ago. Novel and fascinating as
is the book, its scientific value is not very great. Lovers of legends will
find many strange myths introduced in support of the theory. The author,
too, by ingeniously rearranging the verses in the first and second
chapters of Genesis, thinks he has found the key that will unlock all
the troubles that are claimed to exist between the Bible and science.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
